## Model Boundary (LOCKED)

This section defines what the manuscript encodes, what it does not encode, and what cannot be recovered from internal analysis alone.

### What the Manuscript DOES Encode (Proven Internally)

| Layer | Content | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Executable Grammar** | 49 instruction classes, 100% coverage | Phase 20: 9.8x compression, asymptote reached |
| **Kernel Control Structure** | 3 fixed operators (k, h, e) with mandatory waypoint (STATE-C) | Phase 15: 0/100 surrogates reproduced; Phase X: survives falsification |
| **Hazard Topology** | 17 forbidden transitions in 5 failure classes | Phase 18: KERNEL_ADJACENT clustering, bidirectional exclusions |
| **Convergence Behavior** | 100% execution convergence to STATE-C | Phase 13-14: MONOSTATE architecture confirmed |
| **LINK Operator** | Deliberate non-intervention (distinct from other operators) | Phase 16: external termination signature |
| **Folio = Atomic Program** | Each folio is a complete, self-contained execution unit | Phase 22: 83 folios enumerated, 75,248 instructions |
| **Extended Runs** | 6 folios required for complete operational envelope | Phase ARE: 12.6% envelope gap without them |

### What the Manuscript DOES NOT Encode (Proven Internally)

| Claim | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Language** | FALSIFIED | Phase X.5: reference rate 0.19% (threshold 5%), role consistency 23.8% (threshold 80%) |
| **Cipher** | FALSIFIED | Phase G: all cipher transforms DECREASE mutual information |
| **Glyph Semantics** | FALSIFIED | Phase 19: 0 identifier tokens, 0 translation-eligible zones |
| **Material/Product Encoding** | FALSIFIED | Phase PMS: 75.2% of visual partitions show prefix association (non-specific) |
| **Illustration-Dependent Logic** | FALSIFIED | Phase ILL: grammar recovered from text-only data, swap invariance p=1.0 |
| **Step-by-Step Recipe Interpretation** | FALSIFIED | Phase FSS: families are emergent regularities, not structural entities |

### What CANNOT Be Recovered Internally

- Specific substances, materials, or products
- Natural language equivalents for any token
- Historical identity of author or school
- Precise dating or geographic origin
- Illustration meanings (if any exist)
- Physical apparatus construction details

---

## Organizational Layer (Non-Semantic, Non-Executable)

The manuscript contains a human-facing organizational structure that is **intentional but not apparatus-forced**.

### Prefix/Suffix Coordinate System

- **Function:** Positional indexing within manuscript structure
- **Geometry:** PIECEWISE_SEQUENTIAL (PC1 rho=-0.624 with folio order)
- **Boundaries:** 15 punctuated transitions detected, align with quire changes
- **Local Continuity:** Adjacent folios extremely similar (d=17.5 vs random)
- **NOT apparatus-necessary:** Phase ARE Track 1 = ARBITRARY (1/4 problems resolved)

### Section Boundaries

- **Function:** Human-facing organization for navigation
- **NOT distinct apparatus configurations:** F-ratio 0.37 (threshold 2.0)
- **Match codicology:** f25v→f26r = Herbal A/B boundary; f32v→f33r, f48v→f49r = quire changes

### Variant Structure

- **Variants are DISCRETE alternatives**, not continuous tuning parameters
- **Coverage:** 43% (threshold 50% for "tuning space")
- **Interpretation:** Multiple recipes per section, not parametric variations

---

## Apparatus Layer (External, Non-Binding)

Internal structural analysis identifies strong homology with a specific apparatus class. This is **inferential and non-binding**—it does not modify the frozen grammar model.

### Best Match: Circulatory Reflux Systems

- **Compatibility:** CLASS_D = 100% match; alternatives ≤20%
- **Historical Representative:** Pelican alembic (late 15th-century)
- **Structural Homology:** 8/8 dimensions match Brunschwig (1500) and pseudo-Geber (~1300)
- **Surviving Candidates:** Reflux Distillation (1.000), Distillation Column (0.875), Steam Boiler (0.833)
- **Eliminated:** Biological homeostasis systems (failed TEST_3: no external operator)

### What This DOES NOT Mean

- No specific products or feedstocks identified
- No materials or substances encoded
- No alchemical phases or symbols mapped
- Apparatus identification is SPECULATIVE and DISCARDABLE

---

## External Comparative Research (Non-Binding)

Historical manual design analysis (Phase HFM) compared Voynich structure against documented patterns in technical manuals, curricula, and human factors research.

### Pattern Alignment with Historical Manuals

| Voynich Feature | Historical Match | Alignment |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------|
| 49 discrete instruction classes | Brunschwig's 4 degrees of fire | STRONG |
| 17 forbidden transitions | "Fourth degree coerces—reject it" | STRONG |
| 8 recipe families | Antidotaria list multiple procedures | STRONG |
| 0 material encoding | Apparatus manuals omit feedstock | STRONG |
| Expert knowledge assumed | Guild training model | STRONG |
| Kernel control points (k, h, e) | Process control theory | STRONG |
| Local continuity (d=17.5) | Codex organization patterns | STRONG |
| Positional indexing | Medieval recipe organization | MODERATE |
| Quire-aligned sections | Interruption recovery support | MODERATE |

**7 STRONG alignments, 4 MODERATE, 1 SPECULATIVE** across 12 documented patterns.

### Human Factors Rationale

The design is optimized for:
- **Cognitive load reduction:** 9.8x vocabulary compression
- **Error prevention:** Discrete approved procedures, not continuous tuning
- **Interruption recovery:** Positional markers, physical pause points at quire boundaries
- **Expert operation:** No definitions, no remedial instruction

### What This Shows

The Voynich's structure matches **15th-century distillation manual design** (Brunschwig 1500) on 8/8 structural dimensions. The design is **rational and historically attested** for expert-facing apparatus operation manuals.

### What This Does NOT Show

- ❌ Does not identify specific purpose
- ❌ Does not assign token meanings
- ❌ Does not prove historical identity
- ❌ Does not modify frozen grammar model

**Pattern alignment ≠ identification.** See `limits_statement.md` for full epistemological boundaries.

## Physics Plausibility Audit (Phase PPA)

Formal audit of whether the operational grammar is dynamically consistent with controlling a real physical system.

### Verdict: PHYSICALLY PLAUSIBLE (7/7 tracks pass)

| Track | Question | Result |
|-------|----------|--------|
| P-1 | Irreversibility respected? | **PASS** — 17 forbidden transitions are mutual exclusions, no recovery implied |
| P-2 | Energy conservation consistent? | **PASS** — 62% kernel contact, state changes require sustained input |
| P-3 | Latency tolerated? | **PASS** — 38% LINK density, max 7 consecutive waiting tokens |
| P-4 | Noise tolerated? | **PASS** — 9.8x compression, 41% safe margin, low sensitivity |
| P-5 | Control dimensions realistic? | **PASS** — 3 kernel axes collapse to 1-D effective behavior |
| P-6 | Extended stability achieved? | **PASS** — 100% convergence, extended runs scale linearly |
| P-7 | Failure modes legible? | **PASS** — All 5 failure classes map to real system failures |

### What This Means

A competent operator could use this grammar to control a real continuous physical system without violating thermodynamics, conservation laws, or causality.

### What This Does NOT Mean

- ❌ Does not prove the grammar is correct or optimal
- ❌ Does not identify what physical system is controlled
- ❌ Does not validate any historical claims
- ❌ Does not assign meanings to tokens

See `assumption_boundary.md` for full epistemological limits.

## Forward Experimental Inference (Phase L1L2)

Pre-registered falsification tests of whether the grammar maps coherently onto continuous physical process dynamics.

### Lane 1: Control-Grammar ↔ Process Dynamics Matching

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Result |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Unique best templates | 3 | ≤3 | **PASS** |
| F-ratio (between/within variance) | 3.702 | >0.5 | **PASS** |
| Mean match score | 0.636 | >0.35 | **PASS** |

**Cluster Mapping:** 83 programs cluster into 5 groups mapping to 3 abstract process templates:
- TEMPLATE_A: Diffusion-limited process (24 programs)
- TEMPLATE_B: Rate-limited continuous control (17 programs)
- TEMPLATE_C: Equilibrium-seeking circulation (42 programs)

**Verdict:** Programs cluster coherently around compatible process dynamics. No mutual incompatibility.

### Lane 2: LINK Operator Stress Test

| Metric | t-stat | p-value | Cohen's d | Result |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Failure rate | 6.972 | <0.0001 | **1.60** | High-LINK is SAFER |
| Reconvergence | -2.669 | 0.015 | -0.61 | High-LINK slower (expected) |
| Overshoot | -0.277 | 0.785 | -0.06 | Negligible |

**Key Finding:** LINK-heavy programs show significantly reduced failure rate (p<0.0001, effect size d=1.60 = very large). Slower reconvergence is physically expected for damped systems.

**Verdict:** LINK encodes deliberate waiting that confers measurable stability advantage.

### Lane 3: Material-Class Compatibility Test

| Material Class | Physical Traits | Failure Rate | Status |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| CLASS_A | High porosity, slow diffusion, swelling | 0.0% | COMPATIBLE |
| CLASS_B | Low porosity, hydrophobic, minimal swelling | 0.0% | COMPATIBLE |
| CLASS_C | Phase-change prone, emulsion-forming | **19.8%** | INCOMPATIBLE |
| CLASS_D | Non-swelling, rapid diffusion, stable | 0.0% | COMPATIBLE |
| CLASS_E | Homogeneous fluid, no solid interactions | 0.0% | COMPATIBLE |

**Statistical Test:** Kruskal-Wallis H=106.3, p<10⁻²¹, η²=0.93 (very large effect)

**Key Finding:** Only CLASS_C (phase-unstable materials) fails. All 480 failures = PHASE_COLLAPSE.

**Verdict:** Grammar shows differential material compatibility. Phase-stable materials operable; phase-unstable materials destabilize.

### Lane 4: Geometry Compatibility Test (Option A)

| Geometry | Description | Conv Rate | Failure | LINK Eff | Status |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| G1 | Linear open flow | 6.5% | 93.5% | 0.20 | INCOMPATIBLE |
| G2 | Batch vessel | 99.3% | 0.7% | 0.20 | COMPATIBLE |
| G3 | Partial recirculation | 99.9% | 0.1% | 0.20 | COMPATIBLE |
| G4 | Fully closed loop | 100% | 0% | 0.80 | COMPATIBLE |
| G5 | Multi-loop nested | 100% | 0% | 1.35 | COMPATIBLE |

**Statistical Test:** Kruskal-Wallis H=359.3, p<10⁻⁷⁶, η²=0.87; LINK effectiveness d=4.50

**Key Finding:** G1 (open flow) fails completely. LINK maps to physical delay only in closed-loop geometries (G4, G5).

**Verdict:** Grammar selectively compatible with closed-loop recirculation geometries.

### Combined Verdict: COHERENT

All four lanes pass. The grammar is coherent with continuous physical process control.

---

## Exploratory Process Mapping (Phase EPM)

Post-lock speculative analysis comparing programs to each other and to abstract process families. **Explicitly speculative and non-binding.**

### Program Role Taxonomy

83 programs classified across 6 dimensions based on control signatures:

| Dimension | Distribution |
|-----------|-------------|
| Stability | MODERATE 55%, CONSERVATIVE 22%, AGGRESSIVE 18%, ULTRA_CONSERVATIVE 5% |
| Waiting | LINK_MODERATE 47%, LINK_HEAVY 29%, LINK_SPARSE 17%, LINK_HEAVY_EXTENDED 7% |
| Convergence | REGULAR_STABLE 47%, REGULAR_OPEN 40%, IRREGULAR 10%, FAST_STABLE 4% |
| Recovery | HIGHLY_RECOVERABLE 42%, RECOVERABLE 34%, LOW_RECOVERY 24% |

**Special markers**: 3 RESTART_CAPABLE (f50v, f57r, f82v), 10 HIGH_INTERVENTION, 43 EXTENDED

### Speculative Process Family Alignment

| Process Family | Alignment | Key Support |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| CONTINUOUS_EXTRACTION | **STRONG** | LINK = waiting for mobility-limited transport |
| CIRCULATION_CONDITIONING | **STRONG** | STATE-C convergence = target state maintenance |
| REDISTRIBUTION_PROCESS | MODERATE | Hazard topology = preventing runaway concentration |
| SEPARATION_BY_MOBILITY | MODERATE | Template diversity = different mobility profiles |
| MAINTENANCE_HOLDING | MODERATE | Ultra-conservative programs = pure maintenance |
| BREAKDOWN_DIGESTION | WEAK | Bidirectional hazards contradict irreversibility |

**Key finding**: Grammar equally consistent with extraction-type and conditioning-type processes. Internal analysis cannot distinguish.

### Negative Process Matches (Ruled Out)

| Process Class | Incompatibility | Primary Reason |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| PHASE_CHANGE_PROCESSES | STRONG | CLASS_C fails exclusively (PHASE_COLLAPSE) |
| ONE_PASS_EXTRACTION | STRONG | G1 open flow = 93.5% failure |
| ENDPOINT_DEFINED_RECIPES | STRONG | 0 termination signals in grammar |
| HIGH_YIELD_BATCH | STRONG | LINK maps to nothing in batch geometry |
| EMULSION_PROCESSES | STRONG | Phase instability defeats control logic |
| RAPID_THERMAL_RAMPING | MODERATE | ENERGY_OVERSHOOT hazard class |
| DISCRETE_PRODUCT_RECIPES | MODERATE | Grammar describes operation, not production |

### Process Space Constraint

The negative matches collectively constrain to:
- Closed-loop circulation processes
- Continuous indefinite operation
- Gradual cumulative change OR maintenance
- Phase-stable substrates only

### What This Does NOT Show

- ❌ Does not identify specific purpose or products
- ❌ Does not assign token meanings
- ❌ Does not distinguish extraction from conditioning
- ❌ Does not modify frozen grammar model

**Speculative alignment ≠ identification.** See `exploratory_program_roles.md` and `speculative_process_alignment.md` for full analysis.

---

## Adversarial Process Family Comparison (Phase APF)

Stress test comparing two abstract process archetypes against the locked grammar. **Goal: find where each fits POORLY.**

### Archetypes Tested

- **PF-E (Extraction-Like)**: Removal/transfer of mobile fractions, depletion gradients, endpoint-seeking, throughput-valued
- **PF-C (Conditioning-Like)**: State maintenance, no completion notion, cyclic redistribution, stability-valued

### Summary Results

| Metric | PF-E (Extraction) | PF-C (Conditioning) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Structural Coherence | 0.470 | **0.810** |
| Total Tensions | 10 | 2 |
| Unexplained Features | 7 | 6 |
| Contrivance Required | HIGH | MODERATE |

### Feature-by-Feature Fit

| Grammar Feature | PF-E | PF-C | Notes |
|-----------------|------|------|-------|
| 0 endpoint markers | POOR | GOOD | Extraction expects completion signals |
| 38% LINK density | POOR | GOOD | High waiting fits conditioning |
| 100% bidirectional hazards | POOR | GOOD | Extraction is irreversible |
| 18% AGGRESSIVE programs | POOR | POOR | Risky for both |
| 16.9% LINK_SPARSE | MODERATE | POOR | Speed priority fits extraction |
| 12% HIGH_INTERVENTION | GOOD | POOR | Monitoring fits extraction |
| 83 distinct programs | MODERATE | POOR | Diversity fits extraction variety |
| All programs reach STATE-C | POOR | GOOD | Convergence fits maintenance |

### What PF-E Struggles to Explain (Critical)

- **0 endpoint markers** — Extraction is inherently finite
- **100% bidirectional hazards** — Extraction is irreversible
- **High-LINK = safer** — Contradicts speed-safety tradeoff
- **Conservative program dominance** — Extraction pushes limits

### What PF-C Struggles to Explain

- **83 distinct programs** — Pure maintenance should be uniform
- **16.9% LINK_SPARSE** — Maintenance should wait
- **12% HIGH_INTERVENTION** — Active change, not passive maintenance
- **f57r = RESTART_PROTOCOL** — Why reset if maintaining?

### Features NEITHER Explains Well

- 3 restart-capable programs (too few for extraction, too many for conditioning)
- 18% AGGRESSIVE programs (risky for both)
- 5 hazard classes equally present (each expects different dominance)

### Verdict

**PF-C (Conditioning) fits better**, but the difference is not decisive. Neither pure archetype is a clean fit. A hybrid interpretation (Continuous Circulation Maintenance) would require least contrivance.

**This supports the EPM finding**: Internal analysis cannot distinguish between extraction-type and conditioning-type processes.

---

## Human-Track Ordering Analysis (Phase HTO)

Tests whether manuscript ordering and sectioning are structured to manage operator risk, learning, and recovery. **All system-track structures locked.**

### Verdict: PARTIALLY_STRUCTURED (2/5 tests pass)

| Test | Verdict | Key Finding |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1. Order vs Risk | **SIGNAL** | Monotonic increase (rho=0.39, p=0.0004) |
| 2. Boundary Clustering | NULL | Programs randomly distributed |
| 3. Currier A/B | N/A | Insufficient data (all Currier B in corpus) |
| 4. Local Neighborhood | **SIGNAL** | 88% buffering vs 49% null (p<0.0001) |
| 5. Restart Placement | NULL | Randomly placed |

### Key Findings

- **Risk increases through manuscript**: First third (1.69) → Middle (2.00) → Last (2.07)
- **Risky programs buffered**: 88% of aggressive programs surrounded by safer neighbors
- **Transitions smoothed**: Mean risk jump (0.31) significantly less than random (0.44)
- **Section boundaries NOT recovery points**: No clustering of special programs near boundaries
- **Restart programs NOT strategically placed**: f50v, f57r, f82v positions appear random

### What This Shows

- Folio ordering reflects **operator learning progression** (easier → harder)
- Local safety buffering is **intentional** (p<0.0001)
- Risk management encoded in **both grammar AND local ordering**

### What This Does NOT Show

- ❌ Section boundaries do not serve as recovery/restart points
- ❌ Macro-structure (sections, quires) not risk-aligned
- ❌ Restart program placement appears arbitrary

---

## Cross-Domain Comparative Engineering Analysis (Phase CDCE)

Situates the locked control grammar among real continuous processes by engineering comparison, not historical identification. **Question: What would a modern engineer conclude?**

### Domain Alignment Summary

| Domain | Control | Geometry | Library | Human | **OVERALL** |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Reflux Distillation | HIGH | HIGH | HIGH | HIGH | **HIGH** |
| Circulation Conditioning | HIGH | HIGH | MED | HIGH | **HIGH** |
| Continuous Extraction | MED | MED | MED | MED | **MED** |
| Long-Duration Equilibration | MED | MED | LOW | MED | **MED** |
| Batch Processes | LOW | LOW | LOW | LOW | **INCOMPATIBLE** |
| Open-Flow Processes | LOW | LOW | LOW | LOW | **INCOMPATIBLE** |
| Phase-Change Processes | LOW | LOW | LOW | LOW | **INCOMPATIBLE** |

### Hard Incompatibilities (7 domains ruled out)

| Domain | Primary Conflict |
|--------|------------------|
| Phase-change processes | CLASS_C fails exclusively (100% PHASE_COLLAPSE) |
| Open-flow systems | G1 geometry = 93.5% failure |
| Batch processes | LINK semantics void without circulation |
| Endpoint-defined recipes | 0 termination markers in grammar |
| High-throughput production | Priority inversion (stability >> speed) |
| Emulsion processes | Interface instability defeats control |
| Rapid thermal ramping | ENERGY_OVERSHOOT explicit hazard class |

### Engineer's Intuition Summary

What a modern process engineer would conclude without historical context:

- **"This is a control system, not a recipe book"** — Programs describe operation, not production
- **"The author was safety-conscious"** — 77% conservative programs, 17 bidirectional hazards
- **"This requires circulation"** — 38% wait instructions only work with recirculation
- **"Discrete programs, not continuous tuning"** — 83 fixed programs, pre-automation design
- **"Phase changes are catastrophic"** — System designed to avoid, not achieve, phase transitions

### Modern Facility Interpretation

> *"A circulation conditioning or reflux system with pre-automation control philosophy. Safety-conscious, expert-operated, no product specification. The grammar handles operation—outcome judgment is external."*

**What would surprise them:**
1. Complete absence of completion criteria
2. 38% wait instruction density
3. Bidirectional (not threshold) hazard structure
4. 83 distinct programs without continuous tuning
5. Zero process/product identification

### What This Shows

- Grammar is recognizable as **continuous process control** to modern engineers
- Closest matches: **reflux distillation, circulation conditioning**
- Design is **pre-automation but coherent**

### What This Does NOT Show

- ❌ Does not identify specific purpose or products
- ❌ Does not prove historical identity
- ❌ Does not distinguish between compatible domains
- ❌ Does not modify frozen grammar model

---

## Speculative Reconstruction Phase (Phase SRP)

Exploratory speculation about possible materials, products, and workshop context. **Explicitly non-binding—does not modify locked grammar.**

### Candidate Product Classes

| Product Class | Structural Fit | Historical Fit | Confidence |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Aromatic waters** | STRONG | STRONG | **MEDIUM-HIGH** |
| Medicinal extracts | STRONG | STRONG | MEDIUM |
| Concentrated essences | MODERATE | MODERATE | LOW-MEDIUM |
| Stabilized preparations | STRONG (partial) | MODERATE | LOW-MEDIUM |

### Material Class → Real Materials (Speculative)

| Abstract Class | Real Medieval Materials | Grammar Fit |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| CLASS_A (porous, swelling) | Dried leaves, flowers, roots, bark | COMPATIBLE |
| CLASS_B (dense, hydrophobic) | Resins, seeds, citrus peel | COMPATIBLE |
| CLASS_C (phase-unstable) | Fresh plant material, fats, emulsions | INCOMPATIBLE |
| CLASS_D (stable, rapid diffusion) | Alcohol/water mixtures, clear extracts | COMPATIBLE |
| CLASS_E (homogeneous fluid) | Distilled water, pure alcohol | COMPATIBLE |

### Illustrations as Memory Aids

- **Function:** Category markers, mnemonic anchors (NOT operational)
- **Plant prominence:** Root emphasis may indicate root-processing sections
- **Botanical abstraction:** Deliberately non-specific; category, not species
- **Navigation:** Visual bookmarks for expert users

### Calendar/Seasonality

- **Strong interpretation:** Harvesting windows (LOW confidence)
- **Weak interpretation:** Organizational mnemonic (MEDIUM confidence)
- **Environmental:** Winter processing may be optimal (indoor, stable temp)

### Practitioner's Summary

**Plausibly making:**
1. Aromatic waters (rose, lavender, orange flower)
2. Medicinal herbal extracts (dried plant infusions)
3. Stabilized/matured preparations

**Certainly NOT making:**
1. Distilled spirits (requires phase change)
2. Crystallized products (requires phase change)
3. Separated fractions (requires open flow)

### The 83-Program Interpretation

Programs likely represent **substrate × intensity combinations**, not 83 distinct products. An operator might make 5-10 things using many programs depending on material source, condition, and batch.

### What This Does NOT Claim

- ❌ Specific plants or species
- ❌ Specific products identified
- ❌ Commercial vs. personal use
- ❌ Geographic origin
- ❌ Token meanings

**Speculation ≠ identification.** See `candidate_products.md` for full analysis.

---

## Product Isolation Analysis (Phase PIA)

Multi-axis structural convergence test to isolate the most plausible product class. **Explicitly speculative—does not modify locked grammar.**

### Method

10 candidate products scored against 7 independent axes (0-3 each, max 21):
- A1: Process Compatibility (closed-loop, phase stability)
- A2: Control Complexity Justification (stakes, degradation risk)
- A3: Material Class Compatibility (CLASS_A-E alignment)
- A4: Economic & Social Value (1400-1450)
- A5: Frequency of Production (justifies 83 programs)
- A6: Outcome Judgment Externality (sensory, subjective)
- A7: Historical Documentation Pattern (semi-secret, practice-based)

### Final Ranking

| Rank | Product | Score | Confidence | Status |
|------|---------|-------|------------|--------|
| **1** | Aromatic Waters | **19/21** (90.5%) | HIGH | Primary candidate |
| **2** | Medicinal Herb Waters | **18/21** (85.7%) | MEDIUM-HIGH | Strong alternative |
| **3** | Resin Extracts | **16/21** (76.2%) | MEDIUM | Viable subset |
| — | Distilled Spirits | ELIMINATED | — | Phase change fatal |
| — | Fermented Products | ELIMINATED | — | Batch + phase change |
| — | Cosmetics | 12/21 | VERY LOW | CLASS_C emulsion problem |

### Why Aromatic Waters Wins

| Grammar Feature | Aromatic Waters Fit |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Non-semantic grammar | Operator smells what they're making—words don't help |
| Abstract illustrations | Category markers, not species IDs (roses vary by region) |
| No endpoints encoded | Fragrance quality is purely subjective |
| 83 programs | Substrate × intensity × source combinations |
| 77% conservative | Volatiles need gentle handling |
| 17 forbidden transitions | Quality destruction hazards |

### Multi-Product Workshop Interpretation

| Product | Programs Used | Frequency |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Aromatic waters | CONSERVATIVE, MODERATE | Primary |
| Medicinal waters | MODERATE | Secondary |
| Resin extracts | AGGRESSIVE | Occasional |
| Stabilization | ULTRA_CONSERVATIVE | As needed |

### Residual Concerns

| Concern | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| 17 forbidden transitions seems excessive for aromatics | MODERATE |
| 18% AGGRESSIVE programs higher than expected for florals | LOW-MODERATE |
| 3 RESTART programs unexplained | LOW |

### Sensitivity Analysis

Ranking is **ROBUST** across all tested perturbations:
- Doubling any single axis weight: Aromatic Waters remains #1
- Removing historical axes (A4, A7): Rankings stable
- No plausible single change overturns ranking

### Verdict

> **If only one product class were responsible for this manual: Aromatic Waters (90.5% convergence)**

The workshop likely produced multiple products—primarily aromatic waters, secondarily medicinal waters, occasionally resin extracts—explaining the full program library.

See `product_convergence_ranking.md`, `axis_by_axis_scoring_table.md`, `sensitivity_analysis.md`, `top_candidate_rationale.md`.

## Plant Illustration Alignment Analysis (Phase PIAA)

Statistical class-level analysis testing whether Voynich botanical illustrations align with perfumery/aromatic water plant classes. **Explicitly speculative—does not modify locked grammar.**

### Method

30 botanical folios examined for class-level plant identification (NOT species-level). Each assigned to plant classes:
- AF: Aromatic Flower
- ALH: Aromatic Leaf Herb
- AS: Aromatic Shrub/Tree
- RT: Resinous Tree/Shrub
- MH: Medicinal Herb (non-aromatic)
- FP: Food Plant
- DP: Dye Plant
- TP: Toxic/Industrial Plant

### Key Results

| Metric | Value | Null Expectation | Deviation |
|--------|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Aromatic-aligned folios | **86.7%** (26/30) | ~35% | **+51.7%** |
| Food plant presence | 3.3% (1/30) | ~15-20% | **-12%** |
| Dye plant presence | 0% (0/30) | ~5-10% | **-5%** |
| Grain presence | 0% (0/30) | ~5-10% | **-5%** |
| Root emphasis | **73%** (22/30) | ~30% | **+43%** |
| Blue/purple flowers | **47%** (14/30) | ~20% | **+27%** |

### Plant Class Distribution

| Class | Frequency | Perfumery Relevance |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| Aromatic Flower | 56.7% | HIGH |
| Aromatic Leaf Herb | 53.3% | HIGH |
| Medicinal Herb | 46.7% | MEDIUM |
| Aromatic Shrub | 13.3% | HIGH |
| Resinous | 10.0% | HIGH |
| Food Plant | 3.3% | LOW |
| Dye/Industrial | 0% | NONE |

### Negative Control: Systematic Absences

| Absent Class | Expected (General Herbal) | Significance |
|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Grains/Cereals | 5-10% | **SIGNIFICANT** |
| Vegetables | 5-10% | **SIGNIFICANT** |
| Dye Plants | 5-10% | **SIGNIFICANT** |
| Fiber Plants | 2-5% | MODERATE |

### Notable Perfumery Indicators

- **f38r**: Iris-type plants with connected rhizomes (orris root = major perfumery material)
- **f9r, f19r**: Feathery umbellifer-type (fennel, dill, angelica family)
- **f11r, f11v, f37v**: Shrubby forms (myrtle, bay, rosemary types)
- **73% root emphasis**: Unusual for general herbals; consistent with extraction-source awareness

### Statistical Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Perfumery Alignment Index | **80.1%** |
| Null hypothesis (general herbal) | **REJECTED** (p < 0.001) |
| Overall Confidence | **HIGH (85.6%)** |

### Verdict

> **If judged by plant class alone, this corpus IS CONSISTENT with a perfumery-oriented manuscript.**

This finding **reinforces** the Product Isolation Analysis conclusion that aromatic waters is the primary candidate product class.

### What This Does NOT Show

- ❌ Does not identify specific plant species
- ❌ Does not prove manuscript purpose
- ❌ Does not assign token meanings
- ❌ Does not modify frozen grammar model

See `plant_class_assignments.md`, `perfumery_alignment_statistics.md`, `negative_control_plant_classes.md`, `confidence_assessment.md`.

## Program-Plant Correlation Analysis (Phase PPC)

Statistical test of whether program behavior correlates with plant illustration morphology, suggesting intentional material-aware pairing. **Independence requirement: morphology classified BLIND before correlation.**

### Method

24 botanical folios with both program data and plant illustrations:
- Phase 1: Blind morphology classification (ROOT_HEAVY, FLOWER_DOMINANT, LEAFY_HERB, WOODY_SHRUB, COMPOSITE)
- Phase 2: Independent program metric extraction (Aggressiveness, LINK class, Hazard proximity, Duration)
- Phase 3: Statistical correlation tests (Chi-square, Fisher's exact, permutation)

### Key Results

| Test | Statistic | p-value | Result |
|------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Chi-square (Aggression × Morphology) | χ²=4.76 | **0.5747** | NOT SIGNIFICANT |
| Chi-square (LINK × Morphology) | χ²=2.89 | **0.8224** | NOT SIGNIFICANT |
| Fisher's exact (AGGRESSIVE ↔ ROOT_HEAVY) | OR=1.00 | **1.0000** | NO ASSOCIATION |
| Permutation test (10,000 shuffles) | — | **0.6762** | CONSISTENT WITH CHANCE |

### Specific Hypothesis Tests

| Hypothesis | Observed | Expected | Ratio | Verdict |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|---------|
| AGGRESSIVE → ROOT_HEAVY | 2 | 2.00 | 1.00 | NO ENRICHMENT |
| CONSERVATIVE → FLOWER_DOMINANT | 3 | 2.62 | 1.14 | NOT SIGNIFICANT |
| LINK_HEAVY → FLOWER_DOMINANT | 1 | 1.75 | 0.57 | DEPLETED (opposite) |
| EXTENDED → ROOT_HEAVY | 2 | 2.00 | 1.00 | NO ENRICHMENT |

### Morphology Distribution (Blind Classification)

| Primary Tag | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| ROOT_HEAVY | 10 | 41.7% |
| FLOWER_DOMINANT | 7 | 29.2% |
| LEAFY_HERB | 5 | 20.8% |
| COMPOSITE | 2 | 8.3% |
| WOODY_SHRUB | 1 | 4.2% |

### Verdict

> **"There IS NOT statistically meaningful alignment between procedural style and plant morphology."**

All p-values >> 0.05. Odds ratios near 1.0. Permutation test confirms consistency with random assignment.

### What This Shows

- Program assignment appears **random with respect to plant morphology**
- Aggressive programs NOT concentrated on root-heavy plants
- Conservative programs NOT concentrated on flower-dominant plants
- **Illustrations and programs are independent layers**

### What This Reinforces

- Phase ILL finding: Illustrations are **epiphenomenal**
- Programs describe **generic apparatus operation**, not material-specific handling
- Material knowledge is **external** (operator knows what to process)

### What This Does NOT Address

- Section-level correlation (untested)
- Symbolic/non-morphological plant meanings
- Sequential ordering correlation within sections
- Text-based material encoding

## Failure-Mode Reconstruction Analysis (Phase FMR)

Phenomenological reconstruction of what real-world failures the control grammar prevents. **Focus: craft risk, not product identification.**

### The Five Hazard Classes (17 Forbidden Transitions)

| Class | Count | % | Physical Mechanism | Dominant Fear |
|-------|-------|---|-------------------|---------------|
| PHASE_ORDERING | 7 | 41% | Vapor lock, premature condensation | **PRIMARY** |
| COMPOSITION_JUMP | 4 | 24% | Contamination, impurity carryover | Secondary |
| CONTAINMENT_TIMING | 4 | 24% | Overflow, pressure failure | Secondary |
| RATE_MISMATCH | 1 | 6% | Flooding, weeping, channeling | Tertiary |
| ENERGY_OVERSHOOT | 1 | 6% | Bumping, scorching, thermal shock | Tertiary |

### What the Author Feared Most

1. **Phase disorder** — material changing state in wrong location (vapor where liquid should be)
2. **Contamination** — impure fractions passing before separation complete
3. **Apparatus failure** — overflow, pressure events, physical damage
4. **Flow chaos** — rate imbalance destroying circulation rhythm
5. **Thermal damage** — scorching from excessive heat

### Why Failures Are Irreversible

| Failure Type | Why No Recovery Mid-Run |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Phase disorder | Condensate in wrong location cannot drain without disassembly |
| Contamination | Mixed impurities cannot be separated once combined |
| Spillage | Escaped material cannot be recovered |
| Scorching | Burned character cannot be removed from product |
| Flow chaos | Balance must be rebuilt from stable initial state |

### Aggressive vs Conservative Programs

| Aspect | Aggressive (18%) | Conservative (77%) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Link density | LOW (less waiting) | HIGH (more waiting) |
| Hazard proximity | HIGH (near forbidden zones) | LOW (safe margin) |
| Use case | Time-sensitive materials, experienced operators | Valuable materials, training, normal operation |
| Risk profile | Higher failure probability, faster completion | Lower failure probability, slower completion |

**Why conservatism dominates**: Failures are irreversible. Cost of batch loss exceeds any time saved.

### Restart Logic (3 Programs)

| Program | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| f50v | Restart-capable, max_consecutive_link = 17 (extreme waiting) |
| f57r | **Only folio with explicit reset** — encodes intentional iteration |
| f82v | Longest restart-capable program (879 tokens) |

**Why so few**: Most failures contaminate apparatus; restart requires clean system. f57r encodes iterative refinement, not error recovery.

### Author Intent via Failures

**What the book prevents** (explicit encoding):
- Phase disorder from impatience
- Contamination from rushing separation
- Apparatus damage from improper sequencing
- Thermal damage from excessive heat

**What the book assumes** (not encoded):
- Basic fire management competence
- Physical safety awareness
- Sensory judgment for quality
- Material selection knowledge

**What the book deliberately omits**:
- Product identity (none of your business)
- Material specifications (external knowledge)
- Success criteria (your senses tell you)
- Completion signals (outcome judgment external)

### Author Psychology Summary

> "The book encodes my fears, so that you do not have to learn them through loss."

The author wrote this manual to **prevent irreversible failures** observed or feared in practice. The dominance of phase-ordering hazards (41%) suggests personal experience with vapor/liquid mishaps in circulation apparatus.

See `hazard_taxonomy.md`, `forbidden_transition_scenarios.md`, `aggressive_conservative_risk_analysis.md`, `restart_logic_interpretation.md`, `author_intent_via_failures.md`.

## Frozen Conclusion

> **The Voynich Manuscript encodes a family of closed-loop, kernel-centric control programs designed to maintain a system within a narrow viability regime, governed by a single shared grammar.**

| Metric | Value | Confidence |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Instruction classes | 49 (9.8x compression) | HIGH |
| Recipe families | 8 canonical patterns | HIGH |
| Grammar coverage | 100% | HIGH |
| Folios enumerated | 83 (75,248 instructions) | HIGH |
| Translation-eligible zones | 0 | HIGH |
| Model existence | Structure is real, not artifactual | HIGH |
| Model parameters | 2 claims need clarification | MEDIUM |

### Weakened Claims (Require Methodological Clarification)

1. **"Universal 2-cycle structure"** — Dominant cycle is 5-6 at character level, varies with segmentation
2. **"17 forbidden transitions as active constraints"** — 100% legality with or without constraints (never violated in corpus)

## Change Log (Final Documentation Freeze)

### What Was Removed
- Redundant explanations of executability (consolidated to Model Boundary)
- Redundant frozen conclusion statements (single canonical version retained)
- "Alchemical Interpretation" section (implied semantics removed)
- Outdated "Working Model" section with semantic layer labels
- "What Would Advance This Project" section (analysis complete)
- Detailed file listing (consolidated to structure overview)

### What Was Reclassified
- "Kernel Semantics" labels (k=ENERGY, etc.) → marked as **inferential overlays**, not proven identities
- Apparatus identification → explicitly marked as **external/non-binding**
- Prefix/suffix function → reclassified from "possibly operational" to **organizational/positional indexing**
- Section boundaries → reclassified from "possibly apparatus configurations" to **human-facing organization**

### What Was Clarified
- Added explicit "Model Boundary" section defining internal vs external vs unrecoverable
- Normalized terminology: "executable operational control grammar", "positional indexing", "piecewise-sequential"
- Preserved all falsifications in dedicated table
- Clarified that organizational layer is **intentional but not apparatus-forced**
- Clarified that variant structure is **discrete alternatives**, not continuous tuning

### What Was Preserved (Unchanged)
- All 160 validated constraints
- All explicit falsifications
- All adversarial audit results
- Historical phase summary
- Weakened claims with required clarifications
