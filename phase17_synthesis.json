  "INTERPRETATION": "KERNEL SEMANTICS INTERPRETATION\n\nThe Voynich kernel (k, h, e) encodes the three primary control points\nof reflux distillation:\n\n  k: ENERGY_MODULATOR - Fire/burner adjustment - manages energy entering the flask\n  h: PHASE_MANAGER - Column operation - handles vaporization and condensation\n  e: PHASE_MANAGER - Column operation - handles vaporization and condensation\n\nThis matches the physical reality that distillation requires\nsimultaneous management of:\n  1. Energy input (fire/heat source)\n  2. Phase transitions (vaporization and condensation)\n  3. Material balance (reflux ratio and recirculation)\n\nThe forbidden transitions prevent common operational failures:\n  - Flooding (liquid overwhelms vapor capacity)\n  - Weeping (liquid falls without proper contact)\n  - Channeling (vapor bypasses liquid phase)\n\nThe system is designed for robust, repeatable operation by\nencoding these control primitives at the heart of the grammar.",
