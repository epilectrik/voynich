## f72r2 - The Unique One

### Man and Woman at Center

Unlike all other nymph pages which have animals (goats, fish) at center, f72r2 has a **human couple**.

This may indicate:
- Different semantic category
- Special status within the series
- Thematic culmination

### Additional S0 Layer

f72r2 also has an **S0 placement** (5 tokens, 5 lines) not present in the others - possibly related to the unique center illustration.

---

## f72r3 - The Largest

Most complex nymph diagram:
- **4 continuous rings** (R1-R4) vs 3 on others
- **3 nymph-divided layers** (S1-S3) vs 2 on others
- **169 tokens** - highest count in the series

## Center Token Issue

User observes 1 token at center of each diagram, but **no C placement** in any transcript.

This is consistent across all nymph pages (f70v2, f70v1, f71r, and these four).

---

## Oddities

1. **Human couple center** (f72r2)
   - Man and woman instead of animal
   - Unique in entire nymph series

2. **Largest diagram** (f72r3)
   - 7 total rings
   - 169 tokens

3. **Missing center tokens**
   - All four show visible center tokens
   - None captured in transcript

## Nymph Series Summary

The complete nymph page series:

| Folio | Rings | Ladies | Center |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| f70v2 | 5 | Naked | Fish |
| f70v1 | 4 | Naked | Goat |
| f71r | 5 | Clothed | Goat + plant |
| f71v | 5 | Naked | Animal |
| f72r1 | 5 | Naked | Animal |
| f72r2 | 6 | Naked | **Man + woman** |
| f72r3 | 7 | Naked | Animal |

The series shows progression in complexity (ring count) and f72r2 as the semantic outlier.
