## Key Encoding Insight

On these folios, **S does NOT mean spokes**.

| What User Sees | How Transcript Encodes It | Why |
|----------------|---------------------------|-----|
| Continuous ring | R1, R2, R3 (1 line each) | Uninterrupted text |
| Nymph-divided ring | S1, S2 (multiple lines) | Nymphs break text into segments |

The nymph figures interrupt the text flow, so the transcriber encoded these rings as "scattered" (S) rather than "ring" (R).

## Illustration Notes

### f70v2
- **Nymphs**: Naked female figures in tube-like containers
- **Center**: Fish illustration
- **Style**: Highly decorative, stands out from other AZC diagrams

### f70v1
- **Nymphs**: Similar tube-contained figures
- **Center**: Goat illustration
- **Style**: Equally striking

These are among the most discussed illustrations in the manuscript.

## Center Token Discrepancy

| Folio | User Observed | Transcript Shows |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| f70v2 | 2 tokens | 1 token (C: "otylal") |
| f70v1 | 1 token | 0 tokens (no C placement) |

Possible explanations:
- Tokens near center encoded as S1 innermost segments
- Illustration labels not transcribed as C
- Transcription omission

---

## Oddities

1. **Nymph encoding effect**
   - Illustrations change how text is encoded
   - S means "interrupted ring" not "spoke"

2. **No paragraph text**
   - Neither folio has A-like text block
   - Pure diagram content

3. **High ring count**
   - 5 rings (f70v2) and 4 rings (f70v1)
   - More than typical AZC diagrams

4. **Distinctive iconography**
   - Nymphs in tubes
   - Fish and goat center illustrations
   - Unusual for the manuscript

---

## Implications

- Illustration placement affects transcription encoding
- S placement is context-dependent (spokes vs interrupted rings)
- These folios may represent a special category within AZC
- The elaborate illustrations may carry semantic weight beyond decoration
