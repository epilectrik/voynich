## Clothed vs Naked

This folio's ladies **have clothes** - a notable difference from f70v2 and f70v1:

| Folio | Lady Attire | Center Animal |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| f70v2 | Naked | Fish |
| f70v1 | Naked | Goat |
| **f71r** | **Clothed** | Goat eating plant |

This may indicate:
- Different scribal session
- Different semantic category
- Intentional distinction

---

## Center Token Issue

User observes 1 token at center, but **no C placement** in transcript.

This is the same issue as f70v1. Possible explanations:
- Center tokens encoded within innermost S2 segments
- Transcription omission
- Token is part of illustration label

---

## Oddities

1. **Clothed ladies**
   - Distinguishes this from the "naked nymph" pages
   - Same tube containers, different attire

2. **Goat eating plant**
   - More detailed than f70v1's plain goat
   - May carry additional meaning

3. **Missing center token**
   - Visible but not in transcript

---

## Relationship to Other Nymph Pages

f71r appears to be part of a nymph-diagram series:

| Folio | Rings | Ladies | Center |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| f70v2 | 5 | Naked | Fish |
| f70v1 | 4 | Naked | Goat |
| f71r | 5 | Clothed | Goat + plant |

The clothing difference may mark a boundary or category shift.
