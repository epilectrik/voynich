## Transcript Structure

| Placement | Tokens | Lines | Pattern |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| R1 | 40 | 1 | Continuous |
| R2 | 22 | 1 | Continuous |
| R3 | 10 | 1 | Continuous |
| S1 | 20 | **20** | 1 token/line |
| S2 | 10 | **10** | 1 token/line |
| (none) | 0 | - | No center token |

**Total:** 102 tokens

---

## Dense Packing Effect

The illustrations are **more densely packed** than other nymph pages, causing each token to be completely isolated:

| Folio | S1 Pattern | S2 Pattern |
|-------|------------|------------|
| f71v | 16 tok / 10 lines | 6 tok / 5 lines |
| f72r1 | 18 tok / 10 lines | 6 tok / 5 lines |
| **f72v1** | **20 tok / 20 lines** | **10 tok / 10 lines** |

Every single token in the inner rings has its own line number - the densest packing seen.

## The Balancing Scale

### Description
Center illustration shows a **balance/scale**:
- Central rod or beam
- 2 baskets hanging from either end
- Suggests weighing or comparison

### Significance
This is the **only non-living center image** in the nymph series:

| Folio | Center |
|-------|--------|
| f70v2 | Fish |
| f70v1 | Goat |
| f71r | Goat + plant |
| f71v-f72r1 | Animals |
| f72r2 | Man + woman |
| f72r3 | Animal |
| **f72v1** | **Scale (object)** |

The shift from living creatures to an inanimate measuring instrument may indicate:
- Category boundary
- Functional change
- Semantic shift in the diagram series

## Physical Damage

**Hole in page** with damaged token visible.

This physical damage may affect:
- Token readability
- Transcription completeness
- Ring continuity

---

## Oddities

1. **Balancing scale center**
   - Only object (not creature) at center
   - Weighing/measurement symbolism

2. **Dense illustration packing**
   - 1 token per line throughout S placements
   - Most isolated token placement in series

3. **Physical hole**
   - Damaged token in diagram area

4. **Missing center token**
   - Visible but not in transcript (consistent)
