## Summary

Multi-layer ring diagram with a unique **innermost character ring**.

| Layer | Placement | Tokens | Lines | Description |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Paragraph | P | 36 | 4 | A-like text above |
| Outer ring | S | 11 | 1 | Continuous ring |
| Spokes | R | 68 | 22 | 22 radial spokes |
| Inner ring | C | 43 | 16 | Segmented (16 sections) |
| Character ring | W | 6 | 6 | Single chars at center |

## Layout

```

|  [P] Paragraph text (4 lines)            |  <- A-like text
|  36 tokens                               |
+------------------------------------------+
|              OUTER RING [S]              |  <- 11 tokens (continuous)

## The Character Ring (W Placement)

The innermost layer contains **6 single-character tokens**:

| Line | Character |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | d |
| 2 | o |
| 3 | l |
| 4 | s |
| 5 | em |
| 6 | y |

These are spaced around the center with **illustration elements between them**.

### Possible Interpretations
- Positional labels/markers
- Abbreviated form of longer words
- Part of a word ("dolsemy"?)
- Individual glyph identifiers

Note: "em" is transcribed as 2 characters, but visually appears as a single glyph.

---

## Inner Ring Segmentation

The C placement has **16 lines** instead of 1, suggesting the inner ring is divided into segments:

```
Line 1:  shy chtairy
Line 2:  ytoetear
Line 3:  ytey cholam
...
Line 16: ytal air al
```

Each segment has 2-4 tokens. This could represent:
- 16 radial sectors
- Spoke extensions into the inner ring
- A structural division we don't fully understand

---

## Transcript Structure

| Placement | Tokens | Lines | Pattern |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| P | 36 | 4 | Paragraph (A-like) |
| S | 11 | 1 | Continuous outer ring |
| R | 68 | 22 | 22 spokes (~3 tokens each) |
| C | 43 | 16 | Segmented inner ring |
| W | 6 | 6 | Single characters (scattered) |

---

## Oddities

1. **Character ring (W)**
   - Single characters at innermost position
   - Unique placement code for this folio
   - Spaced out with illustration between

2. **Segmented inner ring**
   - C has 16 lines, not continuous
   - Unlike typical ring encoding

3. **22 spokes**
   - Unusually high spoke count
   - Most diagrams have 8-12 spokes

4. **W placement unique**
   - Only appears on this folio
   - Specific to the character ring feature

---

## Implications

- The character ring may represent a different encoding level
- Single characters could be abbreviations or labels
- The segmented inner ring suggests more complex structure than typical AZC
- Transcriber created new placement code (W) for unique feature
