NOTE TO CLAUDE: You may edit this file to add new structural patterns,
surprising findings, or corrections discovered during annotation. This file
persists across conversation compactions. Be thoughtful. Consider the whole folio
structure when annotating lines. When you add observations to folio_notes.json at
the end of the annotation process, carefully consider the whole folio. Add
recommendations for future investigations. Be careful not to skip line 1 on
new folios as you progress. When you compact, keep all the context from this document
along with context regarding your workflow and current step. If a token is already
annotated, remember you can add additional notes if you notice something interesting
about how its used in context to the folio.

================================================================================
WORKFLOW RULES (MANDATORY)
================================================================================

LINE-BY-LINE MODE (Currier A, AZC):
- ONE LINE/POSITION at a time (pacemaker controls advancement)
- BATCH within a single line is OK (generate script for all tokens in line)
- NEVER batch across multiple lines/positions
- Run --next to advance after processing each line

PARAGRAPH MODE (Currier B - PREFERRED):
- ONE PARAGRAPH at a time
- Use --paragraph-out to display paragraph and save expected tokens
- Annotate ALL tokens (even those with existing notes get folio context)
- Use --paragraph-in to VALIDATE before advancing
- Only use --paragraph-next AFTER validation passes
- NEVER skip the validation step

PARAGRAPH MODE WORKFLOW:
1. Run: python scripts/annotate_next_line.py --paragraph-out
2. READ THE PARAGRAPH - actually read it, don't just scan for TODOs
3. ANALYZE before annotating:
   - What is this paragraph doing? (identification? processing? terminal?)
   - Where do tokens cluster? (line-initial, line-final, specific lines?)
   - What co-occurs? (which tokens appear together repeatedly?)
   - What's unusual? (unexpected positions, rare combinations, anomalies?)
4. Write OBSERVATION notes, not morphology:
   BAD:  "chedy: ch-CHSH + edy-MIDDLE" (a script can do this)
   GOOD: "chedy: Clusters at line-final in P2. Co-occurs with qokeedy 4x.
          May mark processing completion."
5. Add notes to ALREADY-ANNOTATED tokens when you see interesting usage
6. Run: python scripts/annotate_next_line.py --paragraph-in
7. If validation fails: annotate missing tokens, repeat step 6
8. If validation passes: python scripts/annotate_next_line.py --paragraph-next
9. At folio completion: add structural notes to Section 43 below

CRITICAL: The --paragraph-in validation is NOT optional. It ensures no tokens
are missed. Do NOT skip directly from --paragraph-out to --paragraph-next.

THE POINT OF MANUAL ANNOTATION:
- Morphology (prefix/middle/suffix) can be automated - DON'T waste notes on it
- Manual annotation exists to OBSERVE patterns a script cannot see
- You are building understanding of how the "program" works
- Each note should add insight, not just classify structure

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- Positional patterns: Does this token prefer line-initial? Line-final?
- Co-occurrence: What tokens appear together? Is this a "phrase"?
- Paragraph role: Is this paragraph doing identification, processing, or closing?
- Kernel access: Where do k/h/e operators appear? What surrounds them?
- Hazard adjacencies: Any forbidden transitions? What's the context?
- FL clustering: Where are escape routes? Do they cluster?
- Anomalies: Anything unexpected based on the structural context below?

DO NOT:
- NEVER write pure morphology notes (prefix + middle + suffix)
- NEVER skip the validation step (--paragraph-in)
- NEVER advance without validation passing
- NEVER treat this as a checkbox exercise

MUST:
- ALWAYS read the paragraph as a unit before annotating
- ALWAYS write observations about usage, not just structure
- ALWAYS add notes to already-annotated tokens when you see patterns
- ALWAYS consult the structural context (Parts I-IV below) while annotating

If you find yourself writing "PREFIX + MIDDLE + SUFFIX": STOP.
Ask: What is this token DOING here? Why is it in THIS position?

================================================================================
PART I: TOKEN CLASSIFICATION
================================================================================

================================================================================
1. RI vs PP VOCABULARY STRATIFICATION (C498, C504-C506)
================================================================================

Every token belongs to one of two vocabulary tracks:

PP (Pipeline-Participating) - 404 MIDDLEs (39.9%):
  - Shared with Currier B
  - Short MIDDLEs: mean 1.46 characters
  - Broad folio spread: avg 7.96 folios
  - PP COUNT predicts B class survival (r=0.715)

RI (Registry-Internal) - 609 MIDDLEs (60.1%):
  - A-exclusive, never reach B execution
  - Longer MIDDLEs: mean 3.96 characters
  - Folio-localized: avg 1.34 folios
  - 95.3% are SINGLETONS (appear exactly once)
  - Provide within-category discrimination

INFRA tokens (da-, do-, sa-):
  - Infrastructure/scaffolding vocabulary
  - Common line boundaries
  - Not RI or PP - structural markers

Use RecordAnalyzer from voynich.py for classification.

================================================================================
2. THREE-TIER RI POPULATION (C831)
================================================================================

RI tokens stratify into three tiers:

SINGLETONS (95.3%):
  - Appear exactly once in entire corpus
  - Maximum discrimination power
  - Folio-unique identifiers

POSITION-LOCKED (~4%):
  - Repeat but stay in fixed position (INITIAL/MIDDLE/FINAL)
  - 0% overlap between INITIAL-only and FINAL-only
  - Positional assignment is LEXICAL, not contextual

LINKERS (0.6% - only 4 tokens):
  - Cross-paragraph bridges
  - Appear FINAL in one paragraph, INITIAL in another
  - cthody, ctho, ctheody, qokoiiin
  - Convergent topology: many sources → few destinations
  - f93v receives 5 incoming links (major collector)

================================================================================
3. PREFIX LEXICAL BIFURCATION (C528)
================================================================================

RI MIDDLEs have LEXICAL PREFIX requirements (not optional):

PREFIX-REQUIRED (334, 50.1%): ALWAYS appear with PREFIX
PREFIX-FORBIDDEN (321, 48.1%): NEVER appear with PREFIX
OPTIONAL (12, 1.8%): Rare - can appear either way

This is per-entry lexical determination, not grammatical choice.

================================================================================
4. LINE BOUNDARY MARKERS (C357-C360)
================================================================================

Lines are FORMAL CONTROL BLOCKS (3.3x more regular than random).

LINE-INITIAL markers (3-11x enrichment):
  - daiin, saiin, sain

LINE-FINAL markers (4-31x enrichment):
  - am, oly, dy

LINK tokens SUPPRESSED at boundaries (0.60x):
  - Lines are structural units, not pause points
  - Grammar forbidden transitions respected across breaks (0/2,338 violations)

================================================================================
5. LINE-1 CONCENTRATION (C833)
================================================================================

RI tokens concentrate 3.84x at paragraph first lines.
Line-1 functions as a "header zone" for material identification.

FLAG: RI tokens NOT in line-1 are unusual and worth noting.

================================================================================
PART II: MORPHOLOGICAL PATTERNS
================================================================================

================================================================================
6. GLOBAL TYPE SYSTEM (C383-C385)
================================================================================

PREFIX families encode morphological TYPE consistently across A, B, AZC:

INTERVENTION type: ch, sh, ok
MONITORING type: da, sa

PREFIX classification applies universally - same function in all systems.

================================================================================
7. GALLOWS DOMAIN COHERENCE (C530)
================================================================================

When RI contains gallows letter X, PP in same record is enriched for X:

k-domain: 2.3x enrichment
t-domain: 2.1x enrichment
p-domain: 4.9x enrichment
f-domain: 3.6x enrichment

Track gallows consistency within records.

================================================================================
8. INPUT/OUTPUT MORPHOLOGICAL ASYMMETRY (C839)
================================================================================

INPUT markers (12 types): ko-, to-, -r, -ey
OUTPUT markers (5 types): -ry (2.4x asymmetry)

FLAG: Tokens with -ry suffix have strong OUTPUT bias.

================================================================================
9. RESERVED VOCABULARY SYSTEM (ct-ho) (C837, C889)
================================================================================

MIDDLEs h, hy, ho are almost exclusively ct-prefixed (98-100%):
  - Creates dedicated vocabulary for linking/transfer operations
  - 3 of 4 linker tokens have ct- prefix
  - Exception: qokoiiin (the only non-ct linker)

Linker targets (f93v, f32r) are structurally distinct:
  - Enriched for: dch (3.7x), fch (7.7x), sch (5.6x), te (3.6x)

================================================================================
10. TWO-LANE MODEL (KERNEL_STATE_SEMANTICS)
================================================================================

CRITICAL TERMINOLOGY:
  - "QO lane" = energy-intensive alternative pathway (k-rich)
  - "CHSH lane" = standard processing pathway (e-rich)
  - qo-prefix marks LANE TRANSITION (switching from CHSH to QO lane)
  - NOT "escape" - QO operates FURTHER from hazard, not closer

TWO-LAYER CONSTRAINT SYSTEM:
  1. CONSTRUCTION LAYER (within-token): k -> h -> e ordering (C521)
     - This is MORPHOLOGICAL grammar for building tokens
     - k, h, e are token-building components, NOT execution states

  2. EXECUTION LAYER (between-token): UNIFORM at character level
     - No statistically detectable preferences between consecutive tokens
     - Real structure exists at the 49-CLASS level, not character level

THE KERNEL (k, h, e) IS MORPHOLOGICAL, NOT EXECUTION:
  - Kernel grammar constrains how tokens are BUILT
  - Does NOT constrain how tokens are SEQUENCED in execution

TWO-LANE FOLIO MODEL (C605):
  CHSH LANE: ch/sh-prefixed EN tokens
    - e-rich composition (68.7% e-class)
    - Standard processing pathway

  QO LANE: qo-prefixed EN tokens
    - k-rich composition (70.7% k-class)
    - Energy-intensive pathway, operates hazard-distant
    - qo-prefix = LANE TRANSITION marker (CHSH -> QO transition)

================================================================================
PART III: PARAGRAPH AND FOLIO STRUCTURE
================================================================================

================================================================================
11. TWO PARAGRAPH OPENING TYPES
================================================================================

WITH-RI paragraphs (63% of paragraphs):
  - Have RI tokens (material identification)
  - Broader PP vocabulary
  - Distinctive prefixes: ke (3.5x), te (4.8x), al, ar, de, lch, lk

WITHOUT-RI paragraphs (37% of paragraphs):
  - Pure PP first lines (no RI tokens)
  - Process annotation referencing preceding material
  - Constrained PP subset (Jaccard 0.164 with WITH-RI)
  - Distinctive prefixes: ct, dch, tch, po
  - 1.35x higher linker density
  - 2.7x enriched for LINK prefixes (ol, or)

BACKWARD REFERENCE PATTERN:
  - WITHOUT-RI paragraphs show 1.23x backward asymmetry
  - Sequential convention: process descriptions apply to just-identified material

================================================================================
12. PARAGRAPH POSITION ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

Folio position predicts paragraph cluster type (chi2=102.22, p<0.01):

  - Single-paragraph folios: 2.67x enriched for LINKER_RICH
  - First paragraphs: Setup function
  - Middle paragraphs: 1.90x enriched for SHORT_RI_HEAVY (content)
  - Last paragraphs: 1.99x enriched for MIDDLE_RI_ONLY, 1.62x WITHOUT-RI (closure)

================================================================================
13. SECTION SPECIALIZATION
================================================================================

Section H (Herbal, 95 folios):
  - 48.7% WITHOUT-RI paragraphs
  - ct-prefix 3.87x enriched in WITHOUT-RI (cross-referencing function)

Section P (Pharmaceutical, 16 folios):
  - 20.8% WITHOUT-RI paragraphs
  - qo, ok, ol prefixes enriched (alternative pathway protocols)

Section T (f1r, f58r, f58v):
  - Contains NO section-characteristic vocabulary
  - Only infrastructure tokens (generic, universal)
  - Functions as template/scaffolding, not specialized content

================================================================================
14. PP NETWORK HUB STRUCTURE
================================================================================

TOP HUBS (by degree and betweenness centrality):
  1. iin: degree 277, betweenness 1.0, freq 618 - THE UNIVERSAL HUB
  2. ol:  degree 208, betweenness 0.467, freq 325
  3. s:   degree 197, betweenness 0.467, freq 227
  4. or:  degree 188, betweenness 0.507, freq 249
  5. y:   degree 181, betweenness 0.32, freq 303

BRIDGE NODES (high betweenness ratio):
  - l:   bridge_ratio 1.17 (maximum)
  - iin: bridge_ratio 1.0 (universal connector)

PP POSITIONAL GRAMMAR:
  CLOSURE MARKERS (concentrate LATE, pos 0.65-0.85): m, am, d, dy, hy
  OPENING MARKERS (concentrate EARLY): or

================================================================================
PART IV: ANNOTATION GUIDANCE
================================================================================

================================================================================
15. ANNOTATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

For each token, consider:

CLASSIFICATION:
  [ ] Is this PP, RI, or INFRA? (Use RecordAnalyzer)
  [ ] If RI: Is it PREFIX-REQUIRED or PREFIX-FORBIDDEN?
  [ ] If RI: Is it a SINGLETON, POSITION-LOCKED, or LINKER?

POSITION:
  [ ] Position in line (early/middle/late) - does it match expected role?
  [ ] If RI in line-1: normal header zone
  [ ] If RI NOT in line-1: FLAG as unusual
  [ ] Is it a line boundary marker? (daiin, saiin, sain = INITIAL; am, oly, dy = FINAL)

MORPHOLOGY:
  [ ] Is it a hub token? (iin, ol, s, or, y)
  [ ] ct-prefix? Check for linking/transfer function
  [ ] qo-prefix? Lane transition marker (CHSH -> QO)
  [ ] -ry suffix? Strong OUTPUT marker
  [ ] Gallows letter present? Check domain coherence in record

CONTEXT:
  [ ] Paragraph type - WITH-RI or WITHOUT-RI?
  [ ] If WITHOUT-RI, what preceding material might it reference?
  [ ] Section context (H vs P vs T) - does behavior match section norms?

================================================================================
16. QUESTIONS TO ASK (for hypothesis generation)
================================================================================

STRUCTURAL:
  - Why does this RI appear HERE and not elsewhere? (87% are single-folio)
  - Does this MIDDLE contain multiple PP atoms? (85.4% of RI do)
  - Does it share gallows domain with other tokens in this record?
  - Is this a potential linker? (FINAL position, ct-prefix, appears INITIAL elsewhere)

RELATIONAL:
  - Does this token appear in adjacent records? (clustered adjacency C424)
  - Is this token in a working-memory-sized cluster? (median 2, max 7)
  - Does the PP composition predict B class survival? (C506)

================================================================================
17. KNOWLEDGE GAPS (what we don't understand)
================================================================================

Track observations that might illuminate these open questions:

WHY SPECIFIC RI MIDDLES APPEAR WHERE THEY DO:
  - We know length predicts uniqueness, but not why 609 specific forms exist
  - What determines which folio a singleton RI appears on?
  - Is there recoverable logic beyond "folio-localized"?

LINKER SEMANTIC CONTENT:
  - Is the relationship AND (aggregation) or OR (alternatives)?
  - Why do f93v and f32r serve as collectors?
  - Why is qokoiiin the only non-ct linker?

SECTION-SPECIFIC WITHOUT-RI FUNCTIONS:
  - Why does Section H have ct-prefix cross-reference pattern?
  - Why does Section P have qo/ok/ol alternative pathway pattern?

================================================================================
18. WHAT NOT TO EXPECT
================================================================================

DISCRETE PROCEDURAL MODES: Data is continuous, not discrete clusters.
The 3-cluster hypothesis failed (k=2 optimal, silhouette=0.286 weak).
Don't force tokens into rigid procedural categories.

SECTION-INDEPENDENT PATTERNS: Section confounding is significant (p=0.019).
H and P sections behave differently. Always note section context.

RI SEMANTIC CONTENT: RI tokens are identifiers, not instructions.
They discriminate WHAT, not HOW.

================================================================================
19. DISCOVERED PATTERNS (add during annotation)
================================================================================

                         AZC ANNOTATION CONTEXT

================================================================================
================================================================================
================================================================================
Last updated: 2026-02-02
Source phases: AZC_POSITION_VOCABULARY (01/31), AZC_B_CONSTRAINT_MECHANISM (01/28),
               AZC_REASSESSMENT (01/28), AZC_FOLIO_DIFFERENTIATION (01/28),
               AZC_PIPELINE_VALIDATION (01/25), AZC_INTERFACE_VALIDATION (01/19),
               AZC_TRAJECTORY_SHAPE (01/19), AZC_REACHABILITY_SUPPRESSION (01/17),
               AZC_AXIS_axis_connectivity (01/16), AZC_constraint_hunting (01/15)

NOTE TO CLAUDE: AZC annotation is POSITION-by-POSITION within each folio.
The pacemaker iterates through diagram positions (C, R1, R2, R3, S0, S1, S2, etc.).
Focus on POSITION-VOCABULARY CORRESPONDENCE - does this MIDDLE belong here?

================================================================================
PART V: AZC CORE PRINCIPLES (READ FIRST)
================================================================================

================================================================================
20. THE KEY INSIGHT: AZC IS A LOOKUP TABLE, NOT A FILTER
================================================================================

CRITICAL MENTAL MODEL:
  AZC is NOT: A filter, gate, router, or active transformation layer
  AZC IS: A static lookup table (PREFIX+MIDDLE -> position)

Each PREFIX+MIDDLE combination has EXACTLY ONE fixed position.
Position encodes VOCABULARY CHARACTER, not causal effect.
MIDDLE composition determines escape/kernel rates, NOT position itself.

OUTDATED INTERPRETATIONS TO AVOID:
  | Wrong Model                          | Correct Understanding               |
  |--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
  | "AZC filters/routes vocabulary"      | AZC is static lookup table          |
  | "Position determines escape rate"    | MIDDLE composition determines       |
  | "P is a diagram position"            | P is Currier A paragraph text       |
  | "Zodiac encodes product types"       | F-AZC-017 FALSIFIED - no strat     |
  | "AZC families differ functionally"   | Differ in scaffold, not function    |

================================================================================
21. AZC STATISTICS
================================================================================

CORPUS:
  Total AZC tokens: ~2,901 (excluding P-text)
  P-text tokens: 398 (Currier A material, NOT diagram)
  AZC folios: ~25-30 folios across A/Z/C sections

TWO FAMILIES (same function, different scaffold):
  ZODIAC: 15 folios with ORDERED subscripts (R1->R2->R3, S0->S2)
  A/C: 21 folios with UNORDERED positions

VOCABULARY:
  70% of MIDDLEs are FOLIO-EXCLUSIVE (appear on only one AZC folio)
  Only 13 MIDDLEs are UNIVERSAL (appear on multiple AZC folios)

KERNEL ACCESS BOTTLENECK (C765):
  AZC-mediated vocabulary: 51.3% kernel contact (lower)
  B-native vocabulary: 77.8% kernel contact (higher)
  -> High AZC mediation = less kernel access = simpler B execution

================================================================================
22. POSITION ZONE GUIDE
================================================================================

                           C (Core/Central)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTION: Interior placement, rotation-tolerant
ESCAPE: Moderate (~1.4%)
VOCABULARY: Balanced PREFIX profile, pipeline vocabulary (PP MIDDLEs common)

EXPECT:
  - No strong PREFIX skew
  - Moderate kernel access (~50%)
  - Pipeline-participating vocabulary

ANNOTATE FOR:
  - Any strong PREFIX concentration (flag as C_PREFIX_ANOMALY)
  - Universal vs folio-exclusive MIDDLE status
  - Kernel character presence (k/h/e)

ASK: "Does this MIDDLE feel like it belongs in a central/interior position?"


                         R1 (First Restricting)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTION: First interior ring, entry point to restriction sequence
ESCAPE: Highest in R-series (2.0%)
VOCABULARY: Broadest pool (~316 unique MIDDLEs across corpus)

EXPECT:
  - Operational prefixes present
  - Vocabulary that feels "active" or "beginning commitment"

ANNOTATE FOR:
  - Vocabulary that seems too specialized for R1 (should be in R2/R3)
  - Compare to R2/R3 - is this MIDDLE more or less restricted?

ASK: "Could this MIDDLE appear in more restricted positions?"


                        R2 (Second Restricting)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTION: Middle interior ring, transition zone
ESCAPE: Reduced (1.2%)
VOCABULARY: Narrowed from R1 (~217 unique MIDDLEs)

EXPECT:
  - More specialized than R1
  - Vocabulary that feels "mid-commitment"

SPECIAL CASE - f57v R2 (C763, C764):
  - 100% SINGLE-CHARACTER tokens
  - ~27-character repeating pattern with p/f variation
  - Flag as COORDINATE_SYSTEM (structural, not vocabulary)

ANNOTATE FOR:
  - Vocabulary narrowing from R1
  - Any MIDDLE that also appears in R1 (note shared status)
  - f57v anomaly patterns

ASK: "Is this MIDDLE more specialized than typical R1 vocabulary?"


                         R3 (Third Restricting)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTION: Innermost interior ring, commitment locked
ESCAPE: ZERO (0%)
VOCABULARY: Most restricted (~128 unique MIDDLEs)

EXPECT:
  - Highly specialized vocabulary
  - Vocabulary that feels "terminal" or "committed"

ANNOTATE FOR:
  - Vocabulary that feels "locked in"
  - Any unexpected breadth (vocabulary seems too general)
  - Confirm restriction gradient from R1/R2

ASK: "Is this MIDDLE appropriately specialized for zero-escape position?"


                    S0/S1/S2 (Stabilization/Boundary)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTION: Boundary markers, outcome locked
ESCAPE: ZERO (0%)
VOCABULARY SIGNATURE:
  ok/ot PREFIX: 42-45% (DOMINANT)
  qo PREFIX: 0-0.5% (NEARLY ABSENT)
  AX enrichment: Highest of any zone
  Feeds B-terminal states: 3.5x enrichment

EXPECT:
  - Strong ok/ot PREFIX dominance
  - Near-zero qo PREFIX
  - Vocabulary that marks boundaries or closures

ANNOTATE FOR:
  - ok/ot PREFIX presence (expected, confirm)
  - qo PREFIX presence (ANOMALY - flag immediately as S_QO_ANOMALY)
  - AX-class morphological patterns
  - Vocabulary that would naturally flow to terminal B states

NOTE: S2 appears EARLIER than S1 (C320) - ordering is backward from subscript

ASK: "Does this token mark a boundary or completion?"


                           P (Paragraph Text)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTION: NOT A DIAGRAM POSITION - this is Currier A material
PREFIX COSINE: 0.97 to Currier A, 0.74 to diagram
VOCABULARY: Linguistically Currier A

CRITICAL: P-text should be annotated like Currier A, not like diagrams.
It happens to appear on AZC folios but is separate from diagram structure.

================================================================================
23. CLASSIFICATION IN AZC CONTEXT
================================================================================

PP vs RI in AZC:
  Most AZC MIDDLEs should be PP (shared with B)
  RI MIDDLEs are RARE in diagram positions (A-exclusive shouldn't appear much)
  70% of MIDDLEs are folio-exclusive regardless of PP/RI status

FLAGS:
  - RI MIDDLE in diagram position: UNEXPECTED (flag as AZC_RI_ANOMALY)
  - Universal MIDDLE in restricted position: note the context

FOLIO EXCLUSIVITY:
  70% folio-exclusive = NORMAL
  Universal MIDDLEs (13 total) anchor navigation across folios
  Annotate as FOLIO_EXCLUSIVE or UNIVERSAL

KERNEL ACCESS:
  Track whether tokens contain k, h, or e
  AZC-mediated should show ~51% kernel contact
  Flag tokens that break this pattern

================================================================================
24. KEY PATTERNS TO WATCH
================================================================================

PATTERN 1: Position-Vocabulary Correspondence Violations
  When a MIDDLE appears in a zone that doesn't match its vocabulary character:
  - S-series anomaly: Any qo-prefixed token (should be 0-0.5%)
  - R-series anomaly: ok/ot dominance increasing (should DECREASE R1->R3)
  - C-zone anomaly: Extreme PREFIX skew

PATTERN 2: Folio Boundary Patterns
  - Note when vocabulary "resets" between folios
  - Flag any MIDDLE that appears on multiple folios (the 30% non-exclusive)
  - Watch for the 13 universal MIDDLEs as anchoring points

PATTERN 3: f57v R2 Anomaly (C763, C764)
  The ONLY folio with 100% single-character tokens in R2:
  - ~27-character repeating pattern with p/f variation
  - Characters m and n as unique terminators
  - Coordinate system interpretation (structural, not vocabulary)

PATTERN 4: Kernel Access Patterns
  Track whether tokens contain k, h, or e:
  - AZC-mediated should show ~51% kernel contact
  - Flag tokens that break this pattern

PATTERN 5: Zodiac vs A/C Behavioral Differences
  - Zodiac: Ordered subscripts, uniform scaffold (C436)
  - A/C: Unordered positions, varied scaffold
  - Note any family-specific vocabulary preferences

================================================================================
25. AZC ANNOTATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

For each token, consider:

POSITION:
  [ ] Position zone (C / R1 / R2 / R3 / S0 / S1 / S2 / other)
  [ ] Does MIDDLE feel appropriate for this zone?
  [ ] Any position-vocabulary violation?

PREFIX:
  [ ] PREFIX identified (ch/sh/ok/ot/qo/da/ol/ct/other)
  [ ] PREFIX appropriate for zone?
      - S-series: ok/ot expected, qo ANOMALOUS
      - R-series: balanced expected
      - C: balanced expected

MIDDLE:
  [ ] MIDDLE extracted
  [ ] MIDDLE folio-exclusive or universal? (13 universal exist)
  [ ] PP or RI? (RI in AZC diagram = unusual)

KERNEL:
  [ ] Kernel characters present? (k/h/e)
  [ ] Does kernel access match expected ~51%?

ANOMALY FLAGS:
  [ ] S_QO_ANOMALY: qo-prefix in S-series
  [ ] AZC_RI_ANOMALY: RI MIDDLE in diagram position
  [ ] C_PREFIX_ANOMALY: strong PREFIX skew in C position
  [ ] POSITION_VIOLATION: MIDDLE seems misplaced for its character

SUBJECTIVE:
  [ ] Does vocabulary "fit" this position zone?
  [ ] If f57v: does this relate to the single-char anomaly?

================================================================================
26. HIGH-VALUE OBSERVATIONS (extend constraint system)
================================================================================

DISCOVERIES THAT COULD GENERATE NEW CONSTRAINTS:

1. Position-MIDDLE Binding Exceptions
   If a MIDDLE reliably appears in MULTIPLE positions, this challenges
   the "exactly one position" claim. Document: MIDDLE, positions, folios.

2. Kernel Character Correlations by Zone
   Does k/h/e distribution vary systematically by position?
   Could refine C765 (kernel access bottleneck).

3. Cross-Folio Vocabulary Patterns
   Are the 13 universal MIDDLEs concentrated in specific positions?
   Do folio-exclusive MIDDLEs cluster in specific zones?

4. R-Series Vocabulary Narrowing Verification
   Constraint claims R1(316)->R2(217)->R3(128) unique MIDDLEs.
   Does annotation support this monotonic restriction?

5. S-Series -> B-Terminal Flow
   S-zone vocabulary is claimed 3.5x enriched in B-terminal states.
   Annotate tokens that feel "terminal" or "boundary-marking".

================================================================================
27. AZC FALSIFIED HYPOTHESES (don't re-test these)
================================================================================

F-AZC-017: Zodiac family DOES NOT stratify by product type
F-AZC-018: A/C family DOES NOT stratify by product type
Both families show NO internal stratification (p >> 0.05).
AZC is uniformly product-agnostic.

ROUTING MODEL INVALIDATED (AZC_REASSESSMENT):
A->AZC->B is CONSTRAINT PROPAGATION, not CONTENT ROUTING.
Vocabulary filtering, not content routing.

================================================================================
28. AZC-SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS REFERENCE
================================================================================

IDENTITY (C300-C306):
  C300: 3,299 tokens unclassified by Currier A/B
  C301: AZC is HYBRID (straddles 70% coverage threshold)
  C302: Distinct line structure (8 tokens/line median)
  C303: Elevated LINK density (7.6%)
  C304: 25.4% unique vocabulary
  C305: Unique vocabulary has labeling signature
  C306: Formal PLACEMENT-CODING axis

AXIS CONNECTIVITY (C307-C312):
  C307: Placement x Morphology dependency (V=0.18)
  C308: Numeric subscripts are ORDERED
  C309: Placement transitions show grammar-like constraints
  C310: Placement constrains repetition depth
  C311: Boundary vs interior position specialists
  C312: Section x Placement strong dependency (V=0.631)

MECHANISM (C441-C444, C765):
  C441: Vocabulary-activated positional encoding
  C442: Compatibility grouping (not filtering)
  C443: Positional escape gradient (MIDDLE composition causes)
  C444: A-type position distribution
  C765: KERNEL ACCESS BOTTLENECK (AZC 51% vs B-native 78%)

                         CURRIER B ANNOTATION CONTEXT

================================================================================
================================================================================
================================================================================
Last updated: 2026-02-02
Source phases: KERNEL_STATE_SEMANTICS, B_CONTROL_FLOW_SEMANTICS,
               RECOVERY_ARCHITECTURE_DECOMPOSITION, HAV_hazard_avoidance,
               REVERSE_BRUNSCHWIG_TEST, KERNEL_ordering_constraints

NOTE TO CLAUDE: Currier B annotation is LINE-by-LINE within each folio.
B is the EXECUTION GRAMMAR - 49 instruction classes compressed into 5 roles.
Focus on ROLE CLASSIFICATION and POSITION-IN-LINE patterns.
Folio = program, Line = control block. Tokens are NOT semantic - they are
instruction roles in a feedback control system.

================================================================================
PART VI: CURRIER B CORE PRINCIPLES (READ FIRST)
================================================================================

================================================================================
30. THE KEY INSIGHT: B IS A CONTROL GRAMMAR, NOT RECIPES
================================================================================

CRITICAL MENTAL MODEL:
  B is NOT: Recipes, instructions, ingredient lists, or readable text
  B IS: A 49-class execution grammar encoding feedback control loops

ARCHITECTURE:
  - 49 instruction classes (9.8x compression from 479 token types)
  - 100% grammar coverage (C124) - no exceptions
  - Universal across all 83 folios (C121)
  - Classes are deliberately over-specified (~40% reducible)

STRUCTURAL HIERARCHY:
  FOLIO = Program (independent processing unit)
  LINE = Control block (positional grammar: SETUP→WORK→CHECK→CLOSE)
  TOKEN = Instruction role (not semantic content)

REFERENCE: context/STRUCTURAL_CONTRACTS/currierB.bcsc.yaml (USE THIS FIRST)

================================================================================
*** CRITICAL: HT DETECTION - DO THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE ***
================================================================================

HT (Human Track / Identification Vocabulary) tokens are B-ONLY SINGLETONS.

HOW TO IDENTIFY HT:
  The pacemaker displays: "Systems: B (1 occurrences)"

  IF Systems == ['B'] AND occurrences == 1:
      → THIS TOKEN IS HT
      → Do NOT apply PREFIX-based classification
      → Annotate as: "HT (B-only singleton). [position notes]"

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  - ~45% of Line 1 tokens are HT (C840: header zone)
  - HT tokens are folio-specific identifiers
  - They do NOT follow PREFIX rules (ch/sh/qo etc.)
  - Missing HT = failing to recognize identification vocabulary

COMMON MISTAKE:
  Trying to classify HT tokens by PREFIX (ch→EN, qo→EN, etc.)
  HT tokens may LOOK like EN/AX tokens but they are NOT operational.
  They are identification vocabulary that labels the folio/paragraph.

================================================================================
*** CURRIER B IS WHERE EVERYTHING CONVERGES - ANALYZE THOROUGHLY ***
================================================================================

Currier B is the EXECUTION layer where Currier A entries and AZC constraints
come together. This is our best opportunity to observe the complete system.

TOKEN-LEVEL ANALYSIS IS NOT ENOUGH. You must also track:

CROSS-LINE PATTERNS (within folio):
  - Do the same tokens recur across lines? (doubled tokens)
  - Is there a progression? (FL stages advancing line-to-line)
  - Does lane usage (CHSH vs QO) change across lines?
  - Are CC tokens (daiin, ol) consistently positioned across lines?
  - Do hazard-involved classes cluster in specific lines?

FOLIO-LEVEL COHERENCE:
  - What is the overall HT density? (expected ~12% folio-wide, ~45% in L1)
  - Is there a dominant lane (CHSH or QO)?
  - What is the kernel distribution pattern?
  - Are there anomalous lines (very short, very long)?
  - Do paragraphs show consistent structure?

PATTERNS THAT SPAN LINES:
  - FL state progression: Do FL tokens show INITIAL→RISING→LATE→TERMINAL
    progression ACROSS lines (not just within)?
  - Recovery sequences: After a hazard line, does the next line show
    recovery patterns (h-entry, FQ triggers)?
  - Control loop continuity: Do daiin-initiated sequences in one line
    connect to ol in subsequent lines?

WHAT TO DOCUMENT IN FOLIO NOTES:
  - Unusual line lengths (Line 6 in f26r had only 2 tokens - why?)
  - Token repetition patterns across lines
  - Lane switching events
  - Any vocabulary that appears in BOTH L1 (header) and body lines
  - Paragraph boundary markers (gallows-initial tokens)
  - Folio-unique vocabulary vs shared vocabulary ratio

THE GOAL IS FOLIO-LEVEL UNDERSTANDING, NOT JUST TOKEN CLASSIFICATION.

After annotating all lines, step back and ask:
  - What is this folio's "program" doing?
  - What patterns repeat across lines?
  - What makes this folio different from others?
  - What should we investigate further?

================================================================================
31. THE 5-ROLE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (C591)
================================================================================

*** ONLY APPLY THESE ROLES TO NON-HT TOKENS ***

Use the 5 ICC-validated roles (NOT all 49 classes) for practical annotation:

ENERGY (EN) - 18 classes, 31.2% of B:
  Recognition: ch-, sh-, qo- prefixes
  Function: Primary processing operations
  Kernel content: 92% (h+e dominant)
  Position: Medial concentration

AUXILIARY (AX) - 19 classes, 16.6% of B:
  Recognition: ok-, ot- prefixes
  Function: Scaffold layer, position-determined
  Kernel content: 57%
  NOTE: 19 classes collapse to ≤2 behavioral groups (C572)

FREQUENT (FQ) - 4 classes, 12.5% of B:
  Recognition: aiin, or, dy tokens
  Function: State markers, self-chaining
  Kernel content: 46% (k+e only, 0% h)
  Position: Pre-final concentration

CORE CONTROL (CC) - 4 classes, 4.4% of B:
  Recognition: ONLY daiin and ol (and ol-compounds)
  Function: Flow control, lane initialization
  Kernel content: 25%
  CRITICAL: CC is NOT a broad category - it is literally just:
    - Class 10 = daiin only
    - Class 11 = ol only
    - Class 17 = ol-prefixed compounds (olkeedy, olkeey, etc.)

FLOW (FL) - 4 classes, 4.7% of B:
  Recognition: ar, al, dar, aly tokens
  Function: Escape routes, state resolution
  Kernel content: 0% (primitive substrate)
  Position: Line-final bias (72.7%)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROLE DECISION TREE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** STEP 0 - CHECK HT FIRST (BEFORE PREFIX CLASSIFICATION) ***

0. Is it B-ONLY and SINGLETON?  → HT (identification vocabulary)

   The pacemaker shows: "Systems: B (1 occurrences)"
   IF Systems == ['B'] AND total == 1 → THIS IS HT

   HT tokens are folio-specific identifiers. They appear in ~45% of Line 1
   tokens (header zone) but can appear anywhere. They do NOT follow PREFIX
   rules because they are identification vocabulary, not operational tokens.

   ANNOTATE AS: "HT (B-only singleton). [any other observations]"

*** STEPS 1-7 - ONLY FOR NON-HT TOKENS ***

1. Is it daiin or ol?           → CC
2. ol-prefixed compound?        → CC (Class 17)
3. ch-/sh-/qo- prefix?          → EN
4. ok-/ot- prefix?              → AX
5. aiin, or, dy?                → FQ
6. ar, al, dar, aly?            → FL
7. Not classifiable?            → UN (unknown)

================================================================================
32. KERNEL STRUCTURE (k, h, e) - TWO INDEPENDENT LAYERS
================================================================================

CRITICAL: The kernel operates in TWO INDEPENDENT LAYERS (C521-C522):

CONSTRUCTION LAYER (within-token morphology):
  - k → h → e positional ordering CONFIRMED
  - k (position 0.443) = latest/activation
  - h (position 0.410) = middle/alignment
  - e (position 0.404) = earliest/stability
  - This is MORPHOLOGICAL grammar for building tokens

EXECUTION LAYER (between-token class transitions):
  - UNIFORM at character level - no detectable preferences
  - Real structure exists at 49-CLASS level, not k/h/e level
  - Forbidden transitions operate on CLASSES, not characters

WITHIN-TOKEN KERNEL GRAMMAR (C521):
  Elevated transitions:
    k → e: 4.0x (energy to stability)
    h → e: 6.1x (phase to stability)
  Suppressed transitions:
    e → h: BLOCKED (0.004x) - cannot destabilize once stable
    h → k: 0.24x - phase before energy
  Dominant pattern: 97.2% of kernel trigrams are e→e→e

ROLE KERNEL PROFILES (C780):
  | Role | Kernel % | Composition |
  |------|----------|-------------|
  | EN   | 92%      | h+e dominant |
  | AX   | 57%      | balanced |
  | FQ   | 46%      | k+e only, 0% h |
  | CC   | 25%      | kernel-light |
  | FL   | 0%       | NO kernel (primitive) |

FLAG: FL tokens having kernel characters is UNEXPECTED - note if seen.

================================================================================
33. HAZARD TOPOLOGY - 17 FORBIDDEN TRANSITIONS (C109)
================================================================================

5 HAZARD FAILURE CLASSES:
  | Class              | Count | %   | Description |
  |--------------------|-------|-----|-------------|
  | PHASE_ORDERING     | 7     | 41% | Material in wrong phase |
  | COMPOSITION_JUMP   | 4     | 24% | Impure fractions |
  | CONTAINMENT_TIMING | 4     | 24% | Overflow/pressure |
  | RATE_MISMATCH      | 1     | 6%  | Flow imbalance |
  | ENERGY_OVERSHOOT   | 1     | 6%  | Thermal damage |

CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:
  - Forbidden transitions are DISFAVORED, not prohibited
  - ~65% compliance rate (34% violations observed)
  - FL is hazard SOURCE (initiates 4.5x more than receives)
  - EN is hazard TARGET (absorbs most forbidden transitions)

KEY HAZARD-INVOLVED CLASSES:
  Atomic (always active): 7, 9, 23 (ar, aiin, dy)
  Decomposable: 8, 11, 30, 31, 33, 41

FLAG: When tokens from hazard-involved classes appear adjacent, note the
      transition. Violations (~34%) are meaningful, not errors.

================================================================================
34. LINE STRUCTURE GRAMMAR (C556-C562)
================================================================================

Lines follow 5-POSITION FUNCTIONAL ROLE GRAMMAR:

SETUP (line-initial):
  - Typical roles: CC (daiin), AX_INIT
  - daiin appears 27.7% line-initial (C557)
  - Gallows-initial tokens mark paragraph boundaries (3.2x enrichment)

WORK (early-medial):
  - Typical roles: EN processing
  - ch/sh/qo interleaving
  - Primary activity zone

CHECK (mid-line):
  - Transition/verification zone
  - or→aiin bigram is checkpoint marker (87.5% directional, C561)

CLOSE (line-final):
  - Typical roles: FL, AX_FINAL, CC
  - ary is 100% final (C559)
  - FL concentrated here (72.7%)
  - Hierarchy: FL > CC for final position

KEY BIGRAM: or → aiin
  - or initiates (85%), aiin terminates (90%)
  - Zero aiin→aiin sequences exist
  - Marks checkpoint/handoff in line execution

================================================================================
35. CONTROL LOOP ARCHITECTURE (C810-C820)
================================================================================

CANONICAL ORDERING:

daiin (0.413) → LINK (0.476) → KERNEL (0.482) → ol (0.511) → FL (0.576)
    ↑                                                              ↓
    └──────────────── RECOVERY FEEDBACK ────────────────────────┘

CC TOKEN FUNCTIONS:
  daiin (Class 10):
    - Position: 0.370 mean (initial-biased)
    - Line-initial: 27.1%
    - Kernel: 0%
    - Function: Initiates CHSH lane (90.8%)

  ol (Class 11):
    - Position: 0.461 mean (medial)
    - Line-initial: 5.0%
    - Kernel: 0%
    - Function: Routes to QO lane (57.4%)

  ol-compounds (Class 17):
    - 88% contain kernel characters
    - Function: CC-KERNEL interface

LINK OPERATOR:
  - Position: 41.7% in first third of line (early)
  - Function: Monitoring checkpoint
  - Routes to: EN (35.4%) or FQ (11.5% if hazard)
  - 85.9% have kernel BEFORE, 83.6% have kernel AFTER
  - "Kernel sandwich" = control transition point

================================================================================
36. RECOVERY & ESCAPE PATTERNS
================================================================================

ESCAPE TRIGGER PATTERN (C875):
  - FQ is triggered by hazard FL states (80.4%)
  - Most escapes resolve in 1 token (84.3%)
  - FL stages that trigger FQ:
    | Stage   | Type   | Pre-FQ % |
    |---------|--------|----------|
    | MEDIAL  | HAZARD | 70.4%    |
    | LATE    | SAFE   | 6.7%     |
    | EARLY   | HAZARD | 6.2%     |

POST-ESCAPE RECOVERY (C892):
  - Recovery enters via h (phase-checking), NOT e
  - Post-FQ kernel distribution: h=24-36%, k=17-25%, e=2-8%
  - Pathway: FQ → h (check) → e (stabilize)
  - Jumping straight to e is rare

TWO-LANE MODEL:
  CHSH LANE (ch/sh-prefixed EN):
    - Primary recovery pathway (75.2% post-hazard)
    - e-rich composition (68.7% e-class)
    - Standard processing

  QO LANE (qo-prefixed EN):
    - Hazard-distant operations (depleted near hazards, 0.55x)
    - k-rich composition (70.7% k-class)
    - Energy-intensive alternative

RECOVERY FREEDOM (C636):
  - Recovery is UNCONDITIONALLY FREE per folio
  - 0/13 REGIME effects on kernel absorption
  - Each folio independently determines strategy

================================================================================
37. FL STATE INDEX (C897)
================================================================================

FL MIDDLEs encode a 5-STAGE MATERIAL PROGRESSION:

| MIDDLE    | Stage    | Position | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| i, ii     | INITIAL  | 0.30     | Material just added |
| r, ar     | RISING   | 0.51     | Heat building |
| al, l, ol | LATE     | 0.61     | Near completion |
| o, ly     | TERMINAL | 0.78-0.85| Final state |
| am, y     | FINAL    | 0.89-0.94| Processing complete |

ANNOTATOR ACTION:
  When you see FL tokens (ary, daly, dam, ldy, etc.), note the MIDDLE.
  The MIDDLE indexes the stage of material transformation.
  Line-final FL tokens (72.7%) typically carry TERMINAL/FINAL MIDDLEs.

================================================================================
38. PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE (C840-C845)
================================================================================

PARAGRAPH = MINI-PROGRAM (not recipe step):
  - Mean 7.1 paragraphs per folio
  - Parallel independent units, not variations on template
  - Each paragraph is self-contained processing unit

HEADER-BODY STRUCTURE:
  Line-1 = HEADER ZONE
    - 44.9% HT (identification vocabulary)
    - RI concentration 3.84x (material identification)
    - Gallows-initial tokens mark boundaries (3.2x enrichment)

  Lines 2+ = BODY ZONE
    - 29.1% HT
    - Operational content

PARAGRAPH BOUNDARY MARKERS:
  - Gallows-initial tokens: t, k, p, f at paragraph start
  - Transition vocabulary shifts between paragraphs

================================================================================
PART VII: CURRIER B ANNOTATION GUIDANCE
================================================================================

================================================================================
39. WHAT NOT TO EXPECT (COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS)
================================================================================

| Wrong Expectation              | Correct Understanding        | Constraint |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Tokens have semantic meanings  | Instruction roles only       | C120       |
| Lines are recipe steps         | Control blocks in loops      | C171       |
| Similar tokens = similar func  | Same class = same slot only  | C506.b     |
| Forbidden = never happens      | 34% violation rate           | C789       |
| 19 AX classes = 19 functions   | ≤2 behavioral groups         | C572       |
| REGIME changes line grammar    | Changes WHAT, not WHERE      | C821       |
| HT tokens are transcription err| Identification vocabulary    | C747       |

DO NOT ATTEMPT:
  - Semantic interpretation of tokens
  - Mapping tokens to specific substances/materials
  - Identifying "what this line means"
  - Distinguishing within-class token variants

================================================================================
40. ANNOTATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

For each token, consider:

*** STEP 0: HT CHECK (DO THIS FIRST) ***
  [ ] Check pacemaker output: "Systems: B (X occurrences)"
  [ ] If Systems == B AND occurrences == 1 → THIS IS HT
  [ ] Annotate: "HT (B-only singleton). [position] [other notes]"
  [ ] If HT: Skip PREFIX classification (HT is identification vocabulary)

CLASSIFICATION (only for non-HT tokens):
  [ ] Role identified (EN/AX/FQ/CC/FL or UN)
  [ ] PREFIX family noted (ch/sh vs qo vs ok/ot vs da/sa)
  [ ] If CC: Is it daiin, ol, or ol-compound?

KERNEL:
  [ ] Kernel characters present? (k, h, e)
  [ ] If FL with kernel: FLAG as anomaly
  [ ] Note kernel ordering if multiple present

POSITION:
  [ ] Line position (initial/medial/final)
  [ ] Does position match expected role?
    - daiin should be initial
    - FL should be final
    - EN should be medial

HAZARD:
  [ ] Adjacent to hazard-involved class? (7, 9, 23, 30)
  [ ] If forbidden transition: note, don't ignore

CONTEXT:
  [ ] Paragraph position (Line-1 header vs body)
  [ ] Is this gallows-initial? (paragraph boundary)
  [ ] LINK presence? (monitoring checkpoint)

CROSS-LINE (after each line, before advancing):
  [ ] Did any tokens in this line appear in previous lines?
  [ ] What FL stage(s) appeared? Does it advance from previous line?
  [ ] Lane usage: primarily CHSH or QO?
  [ ] Any anomalies compared to previous lines?
  [ ] If short line: flag for folio notes

FOLIO COMPLETION (after all lines):
  [ ] HT distribution: L1 concentration vs body distribution
  [ ] Overall lane balance (CHSH vs QO)
  [ ] Token recurrence map (which tokens appeared multiple times)
  [ ] FL progression across folio
  [ ] Anomalous lines documented
  [ ] Cross-line patterns documented in folio_notes.json

================================================================================
41. KEY PATTERNS TO WATCH
================================================================================

PATTERN 1: or → aiin Checkpoint
  When you see 'or' followed by 'aiin', this is a checkpoint marker.
  or initiates (85%), aiin terminates (90%).
  Note when this pattern is present or absent.

PATTERN 2: FL State Progression
  Track FL MIDDLEs through the line.
  INITIAL → RISING → LATE → TERMINAL should progress monotonically.
  Non-monotonic FL sequences are FLAG-worthy.

PATTERN 3: LINK Positioning
  LINK tokens should appear early (first third).
  LINK appearing late in line is unusual - note it.

PATTERN 4: Recovery Entry Point
  After FQ (escape), recovery should enter via h.
  Direct FQ → e is rare and worth noting.

PATTERN 5: Lane Switching
  qo-prefix marks switch to QO lane (energy-intensive).
  Track when folios switch between CHSH and QO processing.

PATTERN 6: Hazard Adjacency
  FL→EN transitions can be hazardous.
  When you see FL followed by EN, check if classes are hazard-involved.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CROSS-LINE PATTERNS (check these after completing each line):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PATTERN 7: Token Recurrence Across Lines
  Does the same token appear in multiple lines?
  - Doubled within line: note positions
  - Recurring across lines: note which lines, positions
  - High recurrence may indicate control anchors

PATTERN 8: FL Stage Progression Across Lines
  Track FL MIDDLEs across the ENTIRE folio, not just within lines.
  - Line 1 FL: what stage?
  - Line N FL: did stage advance?
  - Folio should show overall INITIAL→TERMINAL progression

PATTERN 9: Lane Consistency
  Does the folio use primarily CHSH or QO lane?
  - Count ch/sh tokens vs qo tokens
  - Note where lane switches occur
  - Is lane switching random or patterned?

PATTERN 10: CC Distribution Across Lines
  daiin and ol should appear in specific patterns:
  - daiin: more frequent in early lines? consistently initial?
  - ol: concentrated in specific lines?
  - Do CC tokens mark paragraph boundaries?

PATTERN 11: Line Length Anomalies
  Normal lines: 8-11 tokens
  Short lines (2-4 tokens): Why? Paragraph boundary? Processing pause?
  Long lines (12+ tokens): Extended processing sequence?

PATTERN 12: HT Concentration by Line
  - L1 expected: ~45% HT
  - Other lines expected: lower HT density
  - High HT in non-L1: possible paragraph restart
