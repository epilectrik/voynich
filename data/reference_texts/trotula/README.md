### Notes

- The OCR quality is limited due to the 1544 Gothic (blackletter) typeface
- The Trotula section begins around line 505 in the text file
- Georg Kraut reorganized the original three Trotula treatises into 61 themed chapters

### Relevance to Voynich Research

The Trotula is significant because:

1. **Johannes Hartlieb translated Trotula** into German - he advocated enciphering gynecological recipes
2. **Published in Strasbourg** - same city as Hieronymus Brunschwig's distillation manuals
3. **Content overlap with Voynich themes**:
   - Women's health and reproduction
   - Herbal remedies
   - Bathing procedures
   - Timing/astronomical considerations for treatments

The Rosettes foldout in the Voynich may represent reproductive anatomy according to recent scholarship (Brewer & Lewis), which aligns with Trotula content.

### Scholarly Edition

For a critical edition with facing English translation, see:
- Monica H. Green, *The Trotula: A Medieval Compendium of Women's Medicine* (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001)

Green's edition is based on medieval manuscripts rather than Kraut's 1544 reorganized text.
