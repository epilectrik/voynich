# Plant Class Assignments

> **PURPOSE**: Assign plant classes to Voynich botanical illustrations without forcing species-level identification.

> **METHOD**: Class-level visual analysis based on morphological features (leaf shape, flower form, root emphasis, growth habit).

## Notable Observations

### Strong Perfumery Indicators

1. **f38r** - Shows iris-type plants with connected rhizomes. Orris root (iris rhizome) was one of the most valuable perfumery materials in medieval Europe.

2. **f9r, f19r** - Feathery umbellifer-type plants. This family includes fennel, dill, angelica, carrot - all major aromatic water sources.

3. **f9v** - Blue flowers strongly suggest plants valued for color AND scent (larkspur, borage, cornflower).

4. **f11r, f11v, f37v** - Shrubby forms suggest myrtle, bay laurel, rosemary - classic Mediterranean aromatics.

### Root Emphasis Pattern

73% of illustrations show prominent, detailed root systems. This is HIGHLY significant for:
- Aromatic waters often extracted FROM roots
- Orris root, angelica root, valerian root = major medieval aromatics
- Root emphasis suggests material source awareness

### Absence of Non-Aromatic Classes

- **0 obvious food plants** (no grains, vegetables, fruits)
- **0 obvious dye plants** (no madder, woad, indigo-type)
- **0 obvious toxic/industrial** (no aconite-specific, no industrial oil plants)
