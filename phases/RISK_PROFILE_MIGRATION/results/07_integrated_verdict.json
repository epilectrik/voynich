  "interpretation": "Weak evidence for risk profile migration. The hazard rate is flat (C458 confirmed) but sub-group composition does not shift significantly. The kernel composition shift (C965) is present in non-hazard tokens only. The cross-correlation between hazard sub-groups and kernel types is tautological (EN_CHSH = ch/sh prefix = h-kernel). C965 reflects a grammar-wide compositional drift in the safe instruction space, not a hazard-mediation strategy."
