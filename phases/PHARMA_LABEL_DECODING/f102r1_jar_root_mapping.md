# f102r1 Jar-Root Label Mapping

**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Method:** Visual inspection + EVA transcription alignment
**Status:** COMPLETE

## Structure

JAR → ROOT hierarchy (like f99r/f99v). Unusual/stylized plant illustrations.

## Row 1

| Position | Token | Type | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | **dordod** | JAR | User reads as "daarod" |
| 2 | otodeeodor | root | |

**Illustration:** Crazy looking plant with large leaves and unrealistic giant root.

---

## Row 2

| Position | Token | Type | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | (no jar label) | - | |
| 2 | orolaly | root | User reads as "okolaly" |

**Illustration:** Crazy root system like carrots joining at center. One spiny leaf on plant. No jar label.

## Row 3

| Position | Token | Type | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | **dardsh** | JAR | User reads as "ddardsh" |
| 2 | ???dy | root | Not found in transcript, ends with "dy" |
| 3 | ???loto | root | Not found in transcript, looks like "loto" |

**Illustration:** 2 plants with roots and leaves. Right plant has BLUE roots (unusual). Label overlaps blue root area.

## Summary

| Row | Jar Label | Root Count | Notes |
|-----|-----------|------------|-------|
| 1 | dordod | 1 | Giant unrealistic root |
| 2 | (none) | 1 | Carrot-like root system |
| 3 | dardsh | 2 (missing from transcript) | Blue roots |

**Transcript labels:** dordod, orolaly, dardsh, otodeeodor (4 total)
**Visual labels:** ~6 (2 roots in row 3 not in transcript)

## Observations

1. JAR → ROOT structure matches f99r/f99v
2. Row 2 has NO jar label (unusual)
3. Row 3 root labels missing from transcript
4. Blue roots in row 3 - only instance of colored roots
5. Stylized/unrealistic plant illustrations
