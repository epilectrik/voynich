# f99v Jar-Root Label Mapping

**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Method:** Visual inspection of folio with EVA transcription alignment
**Status:** COMPLETE

## Structure

Each group consists of:
- **1 JAR label** (first token) - labels the container
- **N ROOT labels** (subsequent tokens) - labels variations/contents

---

## Row 1 (Top)

| Position | Token | Type | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | **okaramy** | JAR | |
| 2 | otoldy | root | |
| 3 | otorchy | root | |
| 4 | oldy | root | |
| 5 | darary | root | TWO labels at this position (transcriber merged) |
| 6 | otaly | root | |
| 7 | olsy | root | |
| 8 | arol | root | |
| 9 | otoky | root | |

---

## Row 2

| Position | Token | Type | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | **okoldody** | JAR | |
| 2 | oeeesary | root | |
| 3 | daiiinc | root | |
| 4 | sary | root | |
| 5 | saiino | root | |
| 6 | otolsar | root | |
| 7 | osary | root | |

---

## Row 3

| Position | Token | Type | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | **darolaly** | JAR | |
| 2 | okechy | root | |
| 3 | otal | root | |
| 4 | chor olekor | root | TWO labels merged by transcriber |
| 5 | okeodor | root | |
| 6 | olky | root | |
| 7 | doldam | root | |

---

## Row 4 (Bottom)

| Position | Token | Type | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | **oralas** | JAR | |
| 2 | koleearol | root | |

**Note:** Row 4 is spaced out differently. Token "ychololkeeoldy" appears nearby but is likely Human Track, not a label.

---

## Summary

| Row | Jar Label | Root Count | Notes |
|-----|-----------|------------|-------|
| 1 | okaramy | 8 (includes merged darary) | |
| 2 | okoldody | 6 | No double labels |
| 3 | darolaly | 6 (includes merged chor olekor) | |
| 4 | oralas | 1 | Spaced out, simpler |

**Total labels on f99v:** 4 jars + 21 roots = 25 labels

---

## Observations

1. Structure matches f99r: jar label first, then root labels
2. Two merged label pairs found (darary in row 1, chor olekor in row 3)
3. Row 4 much simpler (like f99r row 4)
4. Possible Human Track token "ychololkeeoldy" - not counted as label
5. Transcriber occasionally merged adjacent labels into single tokens
