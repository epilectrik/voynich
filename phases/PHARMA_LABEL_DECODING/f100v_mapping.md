Labels on f100v are coded with T/M/B placements instead of L in the transcript. Visually they function as illustration labels.

Full plants shown with prominent leaves. Some have prominent roots. **First appearance of flowers in pharma section** - but flowers are NOT labeled. No jar hierarchy.

2. Similar to f100r - full plants, leaves prominent
3. Some plants show prominent roots as well as leaves
4. **First appearance of flowers in pharma section** - flowers have NO labels
5. Labels appear to be on leaf/root plants only
