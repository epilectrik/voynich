**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Method:** Visual inspection + EVA transcription alignment
**Status:** COMPLETE

## Transcription Note

Labels on f102r2 are coded with X placement instead of L. Many are partially illegible in transcript (marked with *).

## Structure

JAR → ROOT hierarchy. Rooty plants with some leaves and flowers.

## Row 1

| Position | Token | Type | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | **ddardsh** | JAR | May be continued from f102r1 or different spelling |

**Illustration:** A few unlabeled plants with prominent roots, leaves. Second plant has a flower.

## Row 2

| Position | Token | Type | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | **okrolda** | JAR | Hard to read; transcript may have as `*o**sal` |

## Observations

1. JAR → ROOT structure continues from f102r1
2. First appearance of flower on rooty plant (row 1)
3. Many labels partially illegible in transcript
4. Rows 1-2 have jar labels but no root labels
5. Row 3 has both jar and root labels
