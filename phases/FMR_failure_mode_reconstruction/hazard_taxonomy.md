# Hazard Taxonomy: What the Author Was Afraid Of

> **PURPOSE**: Reconstruct the real-world physical failures the Voynich control grammar was designed to prevent.
> **METHOD**: Phenomenological inference from grammar structure — no chemical names, only experiential descriptions.

## The Five Classes of Catastrophe

The grammar explicitly prevents 17 forbidden state transitions, organized into 5 failure classes. These represent **what goes wrong in practice** — the disasters an experienced operator would recognize.

---

### Class 1: PHASE_ORDERING (7/17 = 41%)

**The dominant fear.**

#### Phenomenology
Something that should remain in one form suddenly changes to another form in the wrong place or wrong sequence.

#### What the operator sees
- Vapor appears where it shouldn't
- Liquid appears where it should be vapor
- Material "locks up" and stops moving
- Condensation forms on surfaces that should stay dry
- Vapor pathways become blocked

#### Why it's irreversible
Once material has changed phase in the wrong location, you cannot simply reverse it. The apparatus is now in a state it was not designed to handle. Vapor locked in a liquid path may not release without intervention. Premature condensation may have deposited impurities in unreachable locations.

#### Craft experience
> "The moment you see droplets forming on the wrong surface, you know the run is compromised. You can try to salvage it, but you'll never get back to clean operation without stopping."

#### Confidence: **STRUCTURALLY SUPPORTED**

---

### Class 2: COMPOSITION_JUMP (4/17 = 24%)

**Contamination from impatience.**

#### Phenomenology
Material that has not been properly separated or purified is allowed to proceed before it's ready.

#### What the operator sees
- Off-colors in the output
- Strange smells that shouldn't be there
- Cloudiness where clarity is expected
- Unwanted residues appearing
- "Carryover" — one fraction contaminating another

#### Why it's irreversible
Contamination cannot be undone. Once impure material has mixed with pure material, the batch is compromised. Separation requires starting over.

#### Craft experience
> "If you rush the sequence, you'll taste the difference. What should be clean will have a harsh note that no amount of further processing can remove."

#### Confidence: **STRUCTURALLY SUPPORTED**

---

### Class 3: CONTAINMENT_TIMING (4/17 = 24%)

**The vessel is in the wrong state.**

#### Phenomenology
Material is moved into or out of a vessel when that vessel is not prepared to receive or release it.

#### What the operator sees
- Overflow — material escaping where it shouldn't
- Backflow — material reversing direction
- Pressure buildup — sounds of stress in the apparatus
- Sudden release — material exiting violently
- Vacuum collapse — apparatus drawing in unwanted air

#### Why it's irreversible
Physical spillage cannot be recovered. Pressure events may have damaged seals or connections. The apparatus may need inspection before continuing.

#### Craft experience
> "You hear a noise you weren't expecting — a gurgle, a hiss, a pop — and you know something has found its way to a place it shouldn't be. Best case, you've lost some material. Worst case, you've broken something."

#### Confidence: **STRUCTURALLY SUPPORTED**

---

### Class 4: RATE_MISMATCH (1/17 = 6%)

**Flow imbalance.**

#### Phenomenology
Material is moving too fast in one part of the system relative to another part.

#### What the operator sees
- Flooding — a section fills faster than it drains
- Weeping — slow leakage from unexpected locations
- Channeling — material taking shortcuts instead of spreading evenly
- Surging — irregular pulses in what should be steady flow
- Starvation — a section runs dry while another backs up

#### Why it's irreversible
Flow balance is cumulative. Once the system is out of balance, correcting one section may destabilize another. The material distribution in the apparatus has become chaotic.

#### Craft experience
> "Everything should flow at its own pace, each part feeding the next without backing up or running ahead. Once that rhythm breaks, you're chasing problems around the system."

#### Confidence: **STRUCTURALLY SUPPORTED**

---

### Class 5: ENERGY_OVERSHOOT (1/17 = 6%)

**Heat applied carelessly.**

#### Phenomenology
Energy input exceeds what the system can safely absorb or distribute.

#### What the operator sees
- Bumping — sudden violent boiling
- Scorching — material burning on heated surfaces
- Thermal shock — cracking sounds from temperature gradients
- Foaming — uncontrolled expansion
- Runaway — system temperature climbing beyond control

#### Why it's irreversible
Scorched material cannot be unsorted. Thermal damage to volatile compounds is permanent. The "cooked" character cannot be removed.

#### Craft experience
> "You can feel when it's getting too hot — the smell changes, becomes sharper, then acrid. By the time you see smoke or darkening, you've already lost something you can't get back."

#### Confidence: **STRUCTURALLY SUPPORTED**

## Hazard Hierarchy

| Class | Count | % of All | Dominant Fear |
|-------|-------|----------|---------------|
| PHASE_ORDERING | 7 | 41% | **PRIMARY** |
| COMPOSITION_JUMP | 4 | 24% | Secondary |
| CONTAINMENT_TIMING | 4 | 24% | Secondary |
| RATE_MISMATCH | 1 | 6% | Tertiary |
| ENERGY_OVERSHOOT | 1 | 6% | Tertiary |

**Interpretation**: The system is most afraid of phase-related failures. Energy problems, while potentially catastrophic, are apparently less common or easier to avoid.

---

## What This Tells Us About the Process

### Phase sensitivity is paramount
The process involves material that can change state (liquid/vapor), and the WRONG state change is disastrous. This rules out batch-only processes and confirms circulation with vapor/liquid contact.

### Contamination is a lurking threat
Nearly a quarter of hazards involve "skipping ahead" — allowing impure fractions to proceed. This suggests a process where gradual purification or separation is occurring.

### Physical apparatus safety
Another quarter of hazards involve the apparatus itself — overflow, pressure, improper vessel states. This is a real physical system with failure modes typical of glassware under stress.

### Energy control is assumed
Only one hazard class involves heat. Either the author assumed competent fire management, or the system has inherent thermal buffering.

## The Operator's Mental Model

Based on this taxonomy, the skilled operator holds these fears:

1. **"The material will change form in the wrong place"** — Always watching for unexpected phase behavior
2. **"Impurities will sneak through"** — Patient enough to let each stage complete
3. **"The apparatus will rebel"** — Respecting physical limits of vessels and seals
4. **"The flow will become chaotic"** — Maintaining steady rhythms
5. **"I will scorch something"** — Keeping heat gentle and controlled

---

## Experiential Translation

| Technical Class | What an Apprentice Learns to Fear |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| PHASE_ORDERING | "Droplets where there shouldn't be droplets" |
| COMPOSITION_JUMP | "The batch tastes wrong and nothing fixes it" |
| CONTAINMENT_TIMING | "The hissing sound before something escapes" |
| RATE_MISMATCH | "Watching one section flood while another starves" |
| ENERGY_OVERSHOOT | "That acrid smell that means you've burned it" |

## Summary Statement

> **The author feared these failures, in order of severity:**
> 1. Phase disorder — material changing state unexpectedly
> 2. Contamination — rushing past incomplete purification
> 3. Apparatus failure — physical overflow or pressure events
> 4. Flow imbalance — losing the rhythm of circulation
> 5. Thermal damage — applying too much heat too fast

> **All of these are irreversible within a single run. None can be fixed by continuing. All require stopping, assessing, and potentially starting over.**
