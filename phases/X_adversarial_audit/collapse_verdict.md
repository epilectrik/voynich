# Grammar Collapse Verdict

*Generated: 2025-12-31T23:32:57.765712*

## VERDICT: **SURVIVES**

## Collapse Signals

- Real families worse than random partitions

## Survive Signals

- No explicit mutual contradictions
- Kernel candidates converge under merging
- Transitions grow monotonically (coverage artifact)

## Criterion Details

- Explicit contradictions: 0
- Kernel empty: False
- Kernel recovers under merge: True
- Transitions monotonic: True
- Real worse than random: True

## Interpretation

The shared grammar hypothesis **SURVIVES**.

Differences between family grammars are consistent with:
- Partial coverage (absence ≠ contradiction)
- Partitioning effects (random performs similarly)
- Kernel convergence under merging
