## Eliminated Candidates (≥2 Tests Failed)

*No candidates eliminated.*

## Uncertainty Statement

The following sources of uncertainty remain:

1. **Library incompleteness**: Only 6 HIGH-similarity candidates were stress-tested. Unlisted processes may also share operational homology.

2. **Feature abstraction**: Control features are abstractions. Different physical processes can have identical control profiles.

3. **Historical unknowns**: Surviving candidates are structurally compatible. Historical plausibility was NOT assessed.

4. **Interpretation barrier**: Even surviving candidates cannot be identified AS the Voynich content. Operational homology ≠ identity.

---

## Final Statement

This stress test **eliminates** candidates that structurally diverge from the Voynich control signature.

It does **NOT**:
- Identify what the manuscript is
- Prove any historical claim
- Translate any content

**Ambiguity is itself a result.** If multiple candidates survive, that reflects the resolution limit of this methodology.
