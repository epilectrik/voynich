## Test Results

| Test | Verdict |
|------|--------|
| phonetic_clustering | NO_PHONETIC_CLUSTERING |
| ambiguous_tokens | WEAK_LINGUISTIC_SIGNAL |
| modifier_positions | INSUFFICIENT_DATA |
| zonal_zipf | MODERATE_ZONAL_DIFFERENTIATION |
| dual_use | POTENTIAL_DUAL_USE |

## Signal Summary

- Positive signals: 0
- Weak signals: 3
- Negative signals: 1

## Interpretation

Mixed signals detected. Some tests show linguistic properties,
others do not. The manuscript may represent:
- A hybrid system (procedure + language)
- A domain-specific language with unusual properties
- Noise that mimics linguistic patterns
