# Genericity Baseline - Abstract Decoy Systems

*Phase X.4 Part I*

---

## Purpose

Test whether ANY long-running cyclic control system would match 40-day historical traditions equally well.

If decoys match just as well as Voynich Family 2, the correspondence is **GENERIC**.

## Decoy Systems (Abstract Control Grammars)

### DECOY_A: Mechanical Bearing Break-In Protocol

**Abstract Structure:**
```
ENTRY:
  INITIALIZE_SYSTEM
  SET_PARAMETERS

MAIN_LOOP (repeat until operator termination):
  [4-step cycle]
    LOAD_INCREMENT
    RUN_DURATION
    MEASURE_STATE
    ADJUST_PARAMETERS
  HOLD: EXTENDED

EXIT:
  FINAL_MEASUREMENT
  TERMINATE
```

**Properties:**
- Duration: "several weeks" of continuous operation
- Cycle: 4-step iterative
- Tempo: SLOW (gradual load increase)
- No internal termination (operator-determined)
- Entry-loop-exit structure

---

### DECOY_B: Avian Egg Incubation Controller

**Abstract Structure:**
```
ENTRY:
  PREPARE_ENVIRONMENT
  SET_INITIAL_STATE

MAIN_LOOP (repeat until external signal):
  [3-step cycle]
    APPLY_INPUT
    MAINTAIN_STATE
    ROTATE_POSITION
  HOLD: STANDARD

EXIT:
  DETECT_TRANSITION
  TERMINATE
```

**Properties:**
- Duration: "21-42 days" depending on species
- Cycle: 3-step iterative
- Tempo: STEADY (constant conditions)
- No internal termination (biological signal)
- Entry-loop-exit structure

---

### DECOY_C: Monastic Prayer Schedule (Liturgy of Hours)

**Abstract Structure:**
```
ENTRY:
  BEGIN_OBSERVANCE
  SET_CYCLE_START

MAIN_LOOP (repeat for prescribed duration):
  [7-step daily cycle]
    MATINS
    LAUDS
    PRIME -> TERCE -> SEXT -> NONE
    VESPERS
    COMPLINE
  HOLD: OVERNIGHT

EXIT:
  COMPLETE_OBSERVANCE
  RETURN_BASELINE
```

**Properties:**
- Duration: "40 days" (Lent), "7 days" (week cycles)
- Cycle: 7-step daily
- Tempo: FIXED (canonical hours)
- No internal termination (calendar-determined)
- Entry-loop-exit structure

---

### DECOY_D: Cheese Aging/Curing Controller

**Abstract Structure:**
```
ENTRY:
  PREPARE_BATCH
  SET_ENVIRONMENT

MAIN_LOOP (repeat until maturation):
  [4-step cycle]
    MAINTAIN_CONDITION
    APPLY_TREATMENT
    ROTATE_POSITION
    ASSESS_STATE
  HOLD: EXTENDED

EXIT:
  VERIFY_COMPLETION
  TERMINATE
```

**Properties:**
- Duration: "weeks to months"
- Cycle: 4-step iterative
- Tempo: SLOW_STEADY
- No internal termination (sensory assessment)
- Entry-loop-exit structure

---

### DECOY_E: Textile Mordanting/Dyeing Sequence

**Abstract Structure:**
```
ENTRY:
  PREPARE_MATERIAL
  SET_BATH

MAIN_LOOP (repeat for color depth):
  [5-step cycle]
    IMMERSE
    MAINTAIN_TEMPERATURE
    AGITATE
    REST
    CHECK_COLOR
  HOLD: VARIABLE

EXIT:
  FINAL_RINSE
  DRY
  TERMINATE
```

**Properties:**
- Duration: "days to weeks" for deep colors
- Cycle: 5-step iterative
- Tempo: MODERATE
- No internal termination (visual assessment)
- Entry-loop-exit structure

---

## Structural Comparison to Voynich Family 2

| Feature | Family 2 | Decoy A | Decoy B | Decoy C | Decoy D | Decoy E |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Entry phase | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Main loop | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Exit phase | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Cycle steps | 6 | 4 | 3 | 7 | 4 | 5 |
| Extended duration | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| No internal term | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Slow/steady tempo | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | MODERATE |

**Observation:** ALL decoys share the same abstract structure as Voynich Family 2.

---

## Conclusion Part I.1

The entry-loop-exit structure with extended duration and cyclic repetition is **UNIVERSAL** to any long-running controlled process.

This structural shape CANNOT discriminate between domains.

**Next step:** Test whether decoys match 40-day historical traditions.
