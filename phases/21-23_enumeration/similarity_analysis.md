## Interpretive Firewall Statement

This analysis identifies **operational homologies** between the Voynich
control signature and external processes. These findings:

1. **DO NOT** prove identity or historical relationship
2. **DO NOT** translate or interpret Voynich content
3. **ARE** probabilistic similarity measures only
4. **ARE** based on abstracted control-theoretic features

**Allowed interpretations:**
- "Shows operational similarity to..."
- "Shares control-theoretic profile with..."
- "Requires comparable intervention discipline to..."

**Forbidden interpretations:**
- "This IS..."
- "Represents..."
- "Was used for..."
