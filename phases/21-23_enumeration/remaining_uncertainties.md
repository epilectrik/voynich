# Remaining Uncertainties

*Phase ARE - Strictly External/Historical*

## What This Analysis Determined

1. **Prefix/suffix coordinates are NECESSARY** for variant navigation and recovery support
2. **Section boundaries PARTIALLY correspond** to apparatus configuration changes
3. **Extended runs are NOT structurally necessary** (envelope coverage minimal)
4. **Variants are DISCRETE alternatives**, not continuous tuning space
5. **CLASS_D (circulatory reflux) is the REPRESENTATIVE apparatus class**

## What Remains Unknown (Cannot Be Determined From Internal Analysis)

### Apparatus Identity
- Exact apparatus construction (pelican vs other circulatory designs)
- Materials used in construction (glass, ceramic, metal)
- Heat source type (direct flame, sand bath, water bath)
- Scale of operation (small bench vs large production)

### Operational Specifics
- What feedstock(s) were processed
- What product(s) were collected
- Temperature ranges used
- Duration of operations

### Historical Context
- Identity of author/compiler
- School or tradition affiliation
- Date of composition
- Geographic origin
- Intended audience

### Manuscript Features
- Meaning of illustrations (if any relationship to text)
- Purpose of blank pages
- Original vs later additions
- Binding sequence correctness

## What Can NEVER Be Determined From Internal Analysis

- Natural language equivalents of any token
- Named substances, materials, or products
- Symbolic or alchemical meanings
- Historical identity of practitioners
