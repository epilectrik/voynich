# Human-Track Language-Likeness Assessment (Post-HOT)

**Phase:** HLL-2 - Symbolic Label Collapse Probe
**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Prerequisite:** Phase HOT (ordinal hierarchy falsified)

---

## 1. Summary Verdict

**FINAL DETERMINATION: FALSIFIED**

Tests supporting symbolic labeling: **2/5**
Threshold for support: >= 3/5

> Human-track tokens do NOT exhibit consistent symbolic labeling behavior. The linguistic hypothesis is EXHAUSTED.

---

## 2. Test Results Matrix

| Test | Name | Result | Supports? |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
| A | Vocabulary Pressure Test | PASS | YES |
| B | Functional Equivalence Class Stability | FAIL | NO |
| C | Reuse Economy at Attention Points | FAIL | NO |
| D | Order Insensitivity with Role Consistency | FAIL | NO |
| E | Exclusive Role Contexts | PASS | YES |

---

## 3. Strongest Evidence FOR Symbolic Labeling

### Test A: Vocabulary Pressure Test

**Verdict:** PASS - Strong compression to core roles

- Vocabulary compressed to 3 core roles
- Compression ratio: 387.7:1

### Test E: Exclusive Role Contexts

**Verdict:** PASS - Role-context exclusivity found

- Exclusive contexts: 4
- Mean exclusivity: 61.9%

---

## 4. Strongest Evidence AGAINST Symbolic Labeling

### Test B: Functional Equivalence Class Stability

**Verdict:** FAIL - Unstable or non-dialectal

- Functional coverage only 50.0%

### Test C: Reuse Economy at Attention Points

**Verdict:** FAIL - Diffuse vocabulary

- Top 20 tokens cover only 9.2%

### Test D: Order Insensitivity with Role Consistency

**Verdict:** FAIL - Shows ordering or inconsistency

- Low position variance suggests ordering matters
- High transition probability suggests syntax

---

## 5. Final Determination

### Verdict: **FALSIFIED**

The human-track tokens do **NOT** exhibit consistent symbolic labeling behavior.

**Implications:**
- The linguistic hypothesis space is **EXHAUSTED**
- Human-track tokens are navigation/orientation markup, not symbolic labels
- No further linguistic tests are warranted

**What remains possible:**
- Tokens serve as section/position markers
- Tokens are scribal/organizational notation
- Tokens have no recoverable semantic content

---

## Explicit Exclusions (from Phase HOT)

The following interpretations were **NOT tested** because they were already falsified:

- Ordinal hierarchies (low -> medium -> high)
- Ranked intensity scales
- Severity or stress ladders
- Apparatus-global parameters

These remain **FALSIFIED** regardless of HLL-2 outcome.

*Phase HLL-2 complete. Linguistic hypothesis space exhausted.*
