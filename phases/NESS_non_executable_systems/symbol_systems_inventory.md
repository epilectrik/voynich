# Phase NESS: Non-Executable Symbol Systems Inventory

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Prerequisite:** Phase UTC + Phase MCS

---

## Executive Summary

Investigation sought to identify **multiple distinct non-executable symbol systems** beyond the section-level coordinate system confirmed in Phase MCS.

### Primary Finding

**ONE unified non-executable layer confirmed. Additional distinct systems NOT detected.**

The investigation confirms all uncategorized tokens form a single coherent human-track layer. Attempts to subdivide into distinct functional systems yield only weak separations that do not rise to the level of distinct systems.

---

## Critical Verification: Non-Interaction Proof

### Test: Forbidden Seam Presence

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Total forbidden seams in corpus | 35 |
| Tokens at seams - Categorized | 70 (100%) |
| Tokens at seams - Uncategorized | **0 (0%)** |

**VERDICT: ZERO uncategorized tokens at forbidden seams.**

This is definitive proof that ALL uncategorized tokens (~40,000 occurrences, ~11,000 types) are non-executable. They can be removed without affecting execution or hazard topology.

---

### Test: Hazard Zone Proximity

| Metric | Value | Expected |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Mean distance to hazard tokens | 4.84 | ~2.5 |
| Near hazard (≤2 tokens) | 12.7% | ~40% |
| Far from hazard (>5 tokens) | 46.0% | ~20% |

**VERDICT: AVOIDS hazard zones (higher distance than expected).**

Uncategorized tokens actively avoid proximity to hazard-involved tokens, reinforcing their non-participation in the constraint topology.

---

### Test: Kernel Token Proximity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Near kernel-containing tokens (≤2) | 98.7% |
| Mean distance | 1.16 tokens |

Uncategorized tokens are frequently NEAR tokens containing k, h, e characters, but this reflects that kernel-indicator characters are common throughout the manuscript, not that uncategorized tokens interact with kernel operations.

---

## Behavioral Clustering Results

Attempted to identify distinct behavioral families among uncategorized tokens using:
- Positional features (folio position, line-initial rate)
- Section features (entropy, exclusivity)
- Constraint environment (hazard proximity, kernel proximity)
- Co-occurrence profiles (context diversity)

### Cluster Analysis

| Cluster | Size | LI Rate | Section Exclusivity | Hazard Distance | Classification |
|---------|------|---------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 3 | 362 | 21.5% | 62.0% | 4.0 | Section-local variant |
| 1 | 221 | 13.1% | 42.6% | 4.7 | Cross-sectional variant |
| 2 | 199 | 16.6% | 49.5% | 6.2 | High hazard-avoidance |

**All classifications are LOW confidence.** The clusters represent continuous variation within a single system, not distinct functional systems.

---

## Section Variation Analysis

| Section | Uncategorized Rate | Line-Initial Rate |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| A | 62.3% | 37.8% |
| Z | 61.4% | 34.8% |
| P | 46.6% | 29.3% |
| T | 46.9% | 18.5% |
| C | 46.3% | 21.8% |
| H | 42.0% | 20.5% |
| S | 38.8% | 15.9% |
| B | 28.3% | 19.8% |

**Coefficient of Variation: 0.24** (moderate variation)

Sections A and Z (Astronomy/Zodiac) have highest uncategorized rates (61-62%). Section B (Biological) has lowest (28.3%). This variation is consistent with section-specific organizational needs but does not indicate distinct symbol systems.

---

## Illustration Correlation

| Category | Uncategorized Rate |
|----------|-------------------|
| Illustrated sections (H,C,A,Z,B,P) | 47.8% |
| Text-only sections (S,T) | 42.8% |
| **Difference** | **5.0%** |

The difference is too small to support "illustration-dependent" symbol systems. Illustrations do not create distinct navigational requirements detectable at the token level.

---

## Candidate Systems Evaluated

### Category A: Navigation/Orientation

**STATUS: CONFIRMED (Phase MCS)**

Already documented as section-level coordinate system:
- 80.7% of types section-exclusive
- 9.1% vocabulary overlap across manuscript thirds
- Morphologically distinct from operational grammar

This investigation REINFORCES but does not extend this finding.

---

### Category B: Memory/Redundancy Systems

**STATUS: NOT DETECTED**

No distinct cluster of tokens shows the expected signature:
- Repetitive but behaviorally inconsistent
- Replacement-tolerant
- Memory-aid function

The behavioral clustering did not isolate a memory/redundancy population distinct from the navigation system.

---

### Category C: Attention-Guidance Systems

**STATUS: WEAK (LOW CONFIDENCE)**

Cluster 2 (199 tokens) shows highest hazard avoidance (6.2 tokens mean distance), potentially consistent with "hazard-avoiding attention markers." However:
- Classification confidence is LOW
- No distinct positional signature
- Sample tokens overlap morphologically with other clusters

**Verdict: Insufficient evidence for distinct attention-guidance system.**

---

### Category D: Section Tradition/Workshop Layering

**STATUS: NOT DISTINCT FROM CATEGORY A**

Section variation in uncategorized rate (A/Z high, B low) could reflect workshop/tradition differences, but this is inseparable from the section-level coordinate system already documented. These are not distinct systems.

---

### Category E: Scribal/Transmission Artifacts

**STATUS: NOT DETECTED AS DISTINCT POPULATION**

No cluster shows the expected signature:
- Irregular, behaviorally inconsistent
- Isolated, non-systematic
- Low frequency, high dispersion

Some individual low-frequency tokens may be scribal artifacts, but they do not form a detectable systematic layer.

---

## Removal Simulation (Conceptual)

**If all uncategorized tokens were removed:**

| Impact Category | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| Execution | NONE - hazards unchanged, grammar unchanged |
| Navigation | SEVERE - section identity lost, position unknown |
| Memory | MODERATE - reduced redundancy and memory aids |
| Attention | UNKNOWN - possible rhythm disruption |

The removal simulation confirms uncategorized tokens are human-facing infrastructure, not apparatus logic.

---

## Final Inventory

### CONFIRMED SYSTEMS

| System | Scope | Function | Confidence |
|--------|-------|----------|------------|
| Section-Level Coordinate | Section-local | Navigation/orientation | **HIGH** |

### NOT DETECTED

| Candidate System | Reason |
|------------------|--------|
| Memory/Redundancy | No distinct behavioral cluster |
| Attention-Guidance | Weak separation, low confidence |
| Section Tradition | Inseparable from coordinate system |
| Scribal Artifacts | No systematic population |

---

## Interpretation

### What Was Found

1. **Zero forbidden-seam presence** — Definitive non-interaction proof
2. **Hazard avoidance pattern** — Active distancing from constraint zones
3. **Single coherent layer** — Not multiple distinct systems
4. **Internal variation** — Continuous, not categorical

### What Was NOT Found

1. **Multiple distinct symbol systems** — Clusters are weak, continuous
2. **Memory/redundancy layer** — No distinct signature detected
3. **Attention-guidance layer** — Insufficient evidence
4. **Workshop/tradition markers** — Inseparable from navigation

## Structural Model (Updated)

```
MANUSCRIPT ARCHITECTURE (Two-Track)
====================================

TRACK 1: OPERATIONAL GRAMMAR (frozen)
  - 479 categorized tokens
  - 49 instruction classes
  - Hazard topology (17 forbidden transitions)
  - Kernel control structure (k, h, e)
  - 100% execution coverage

TRACK 2: HUMAN-TRACK COORDINATE SYSTEM (this finding)
  - ~11,000 uncategorized types
  - SINGLE unified layer (not multiple systems)
  - Section-local organization (80.7% exclusive)
  - Morphologically distinct
  - ZERO presence at forbidden seams
  - Function: Navigation, orientation, position-in-manuscript

RELATIONSHIP:
  - Tracks are INDEPENDENT
  - Track 2 can be removed without affecting Track 1
  - Track 2 has internal variation but NOT distinct subsystems
```

---

## Stopping Condition Met

Investigation stopped because:

1. **Additional clusters collapse into continuous variation** — No categorical boundaries detected
2. **No new function classes survive interaction testing** — Only navigation confirmed
3. **Findings are consistent with already documented system** — Section-level coordinate system

Further subdivision would be arbitrary partitioning of a continuous layer.

---

## Constraints for Future Work

### LOCKED

1. Uncategorized tokens are **ONE coherent non-executable layer**
2. They **NEVER appear at forbidden seams** (0/35)
3. They **actively avoid hazard zones** (mean 4.84 vs expected 2.5)
4. Internal variation is **continuous, not categorical**
5. Section-level coordinate function is the **dominant and perhaps only function**

### DO NOT

- Propose additional "hidden" symbol systems without new external evidence
- Subdivide uncategorized tokens into arbitrary categories
- Assign operational semantics to any uncategorized token
- Treat section-specific variation as distinct "workshop styles" or "traditions"
