# EXT-4 Material Evaluation Table

**Phase:** EXT-4 (Material & Botanical Correlation)
**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Purpose:** Elimination of materials that do not justify OPS-level hazard fear and catastrophic restart loss

---

## Evaluation Criteria

For a material to SURVIVE, it must satisfy ALL of the following:

1. **Process Linkage:** Historically subjected to circulatio, cohobatio, athanor digestion, or quintessence operations
2. **Duration:** Required weeks to months of operation (not hours or days)
3. **Failure Severity:** Failure destroys accumulated work (not just yield)
4. **Restart Catastrophe:** Historical practitioners treated restart as economically or temporally catastrophic
5. **Expert Context:** Required guild-level expertise; not household or commercial-scale

**Automatic Elimination:**
- Primarily aromatic/perfumery
- Culinary or alimentary
- Easily replaceable (cheap base materials)
- Economically scaled (commercial production)
- Safe to discard mid-process
- Endpoint-defined (batch processes with completion criteria)

## Detailed Material Assessments

### SURVIVORS (Tier 2)

#### 1. Philosophical Mercury (Mercuric Chloride / Corrosive Sublimate)

| Criterion | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Historical Evidence | **STRONG** | *Liber de aluminibus et salibus* (13th c.); pseudo-Geber *Summa Perfectionis* (~1300); *Testamentum* (1330s) |
| Process Linkage | Sublimation + Digestion + Cohobatio | Mercury sublimed with vitriol and salt; digested for weeks |
| Duration | **Weeks to Months** | Multiple sublimation-digestion cycles required |
| Failure Modes | Contamination, Volatilization, Incorrect crystallization | Irreversible once contaminated |
| Restart Cost | **CATASTROPHIC** | Mercury lost, apparatus contaminated, weeks of work destroyed |
| Toxicity | **LETHAL** | Mercury poisoning causes irreversible neurological damage |

**Why This Survives:**
- All 5 OPS hazard classes present (PHASE_ORDERING in sublimation, COMPOSITION_JUMP in impurity, CONTAINMENT_TIMING in sealing, ENERGY_OVERSHOOT in overheating, RATE_MISMATCH in flow)
- Restart destroys accumulated purification work
- Expert-only context (guild-restricted knowledge)
- Historical emphasis on patience and precision

#### 2. Antimony Preparations (Stibnite, Kermes Mineral)

| Criterion | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Historical Evidence | **STRONG** | Pseudo-Geber *Summa Perfectionis* (14th c.); John of Rupescissa (~1351); Eirenaeus Philalethes (17th c.) |
| Process Linkage | Digestion + Calcination + Reduction | Stibnite calcined to oxide, reduced to regulus, digested |
| Duration | **Weeks** | Calcination + digestion cycles |
| Failure Modes | Incorrect calcination, Contamination, Loss of sulfide fraction | Irreversible once composition shifted |
| Restart Cost | **HIGH** | Material partially recoverable but weeks of work lost |
| Toxicity | **HIGH** | Antimony compounds toxic when ingested or absorbed through skin |

**Why This Survives:**
- Phase ordering critical (calcination sequence matters)
- Composition jumps from incorrect processing destroy batch
- Expert-only context (antimony preparations were guild-restricted)
- John of Rupescissa explicitly linked antimony quintessence to medical efficacy

| Process Linkage | Athanor Digestion | Mercury + lead/gold digested for 40+ days |
| Duration | **40+ days minimum** | "Philosophical month" of 40 days documented; Ripley: "6 whole weeks" |
| Failure Modes | Mercury volatilization, Incorrect phase sequence, Contamination | Irreversible |
| Restart Cost | **CATASTROPHIC** | 40+ days of work lost; apparatus contaminated |
| Toxicity | **LETHAL** | Five Tang emperors died from elixir poisoning; Jiajing Emperor (Ming) died from mercury elixir |

**Why This Survives:**
- Extreme duration (40+ days minimum) makes restart catastrophic
- Mercury is the archetype of OPS hazards (volatile, toxic, phase-sensitive)
- Historical record shows practitioners feared failure above all

### MARGINAL (Tier 3)

#### 5. Sal Ammoniac (Ammonium Chloride)

| Criterion | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Historical Evidence | **STRONG** | Albertus Magnus *De alchymia* (13th c.); "Latin Geber" *Invention of Verity* (13th c.) |
| Process Linkage | Putrefaction + Digestion + Sublimation | Urine putrefied 1 month, digested 1 month, sublimed |
| Duration | **2-3 months** | Month for putrefaction + month for digestion + sublimation cycles |
| Failure Modes | Contamination, Incorrect sublimation, Ammonia/HCl dissociation | Recoverable in some cases |
| Restart Cost | **MODERATE** | Time lost significant; materials (urine) are free |
| Toxicity | **MODERATE** | Corrosive on sublimation (ammonia + HCl) |

**Why MARGINAL:**
- Duration meets threshold (2-3 months)
- BUT base materials are essentially free (urine, salt, soot)
- Restart loses TIME but not expensive materials
- Survives as Tier 3 because time investment is substantial

| Process Linkage | Distillation from green vitriol | Roasting + multiple distillations |
| Duration | **Days to Weeks** | Shorter than other survivors |
| Failure Modes | Incomplete distillation, Contamination, Apparatus corrosion | Partially recoverable |
| Restart Cost | **MODERATE** | Apparatus damaged by corrosion; material not lost |
| Toxicity | **EXTREME** | Severely corrosive; causes permanent blindness, internal organ damage |

**Why MARGINAL:**
- Extreme hazard profile (corrosive) matches OPS
- BUT duration is shorter than other survivors
- Restart cost is moderate (apparatus damage, not material loss)
- Survives as Tier 3 because hazard profile is significant

### ELIMINATED

See `EXT4_elimination_log.md` for detailed elimination rationale.

---

## Statistical Summary

| Category | Evaluated | Survived | Marginal | Eliminated | Survival Rate |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|------------|---------------|
| 🧂 Mineral | 6 | 4 | 2 | 0 | **100%** (4 Tier 2, 2 Tier 3) |
| 🌿 Botanical | 9 | 0 | 0 | 9 | **0%** |
| **Total** | **15** | **4** | **2** | **9** | **40%** (6 with marginal) |

---

## Key Discriminating Factors

### What Separates Survivors from Eliminated

1. **Duration Threshold:** Survivors require weeks to months; eliminated materials process in hours to days
2. **Material Economics:** Survivors use expensive/scarce materials (gold, mercury); eliminated use cheap/abundant (wine, roses, herbs)
3. **Restart Catastrophe:** Survivors lose accumulated work AND expensive materials; eliminated lose only time
4. **Toxicity as Hazard Proxy:** All survivors are toxic or corrosive; most eliminated are relatively safe
5. **Expert Context:** Survivors were guild-restricted; eliminated were commercial or household

### Critical Finding: Botanical Materials FAIL

**All botanical materials are eliminated.** This is the most significant finding of EXT-4.

| Factor | Botanical Materials | Mineral Materials |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Typical Duration | Hours to Days | Weeks to Months |
| Material Cost | LOW (plants, wine) | HIGH (gold, mercury) |
| Restart Cost | TRIVIAL to LOW | HIGH to CATASTROPHIC |
| Toxicity | LOW to MODERATE | HIGH to LETHAL |
| Historical Context | Commercial, Household | Expert, Guild-restricted |

**Implication:** The OPS hazard topology (41% PHASE_ORDERING, 24% COMPOSITION_JUMP, etc.) does NOT match the failure profile of botanical/aromatic processing. It DOES match mineral/metallic processing.

---

## Survivor Material Cluster

The 4 Tier 2 survivors form a coherent cluster:

| Property | All Survivors Share |
|----------|---------------------|
| Base Element | Mercury OR Gold OR Antimony |
| Processing Context | Alchemical/Medical, NOT commercial |
| Duration | Weeks to Months |
| Failure Mode | Toxic, Corrosive, Irreversible |
| Restart | Destroys weeks/months of work |
| Historical Documentation | Expert texts, NOT household manuals |

**This cluster is:**
- **ALCHEMICAL-MEDICAL** (not aromatic, not culinary)
- **MINERAL-CENTRIC** (not botanical)
- **EXPERT-RESTRICTED** (not commercial-scale)

---

## Conflict with Previous Phases

### EXT-4 vs. PIA/PIAA

Previous phases (PIA, PIAA) identified **aromatic waters** as the primary candidate product class. EXT-4 applies a different filter: **OPS-level hazard justification**.

| Phase | Conclusion | Method |
|-------|------------|--------|
| PIA | Aromatic waters 90.5% convergence | Multi-axis structural fit |
| PIAA | 86.7% perfumery-aligned | Plant illustration class analysis |
| **EXT-4** | **Aromatic materials ELIMINATED** | Hazard/restart economic filtering |

**Resolution:** The aromatic interpretation does NOT survive hazard-economic testing. Aromatic water production:
- Tolerates restart (fresh petals available)
- Values throughput (commercial scale)
- Has short duration (hours, not months)
- Has low failure cost (batch loss, not catastrophic)

The OPS hazard topology is INCOMPATIBLE with aromatic production. It IS compatible with alchemical-medical mineral processing.

### This Is A Key Finding

> **The manuscript's hazard structure is too severe for aromatics.**
> **It is appropriately severe for alchemical mineral preparations.**
