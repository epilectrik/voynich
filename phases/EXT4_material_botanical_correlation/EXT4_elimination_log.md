# EXT-4 Elimination Log

**Phase:** EXT-4 (Material & Botanical Correlation)
**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Purpose:** Explicit documentation of materials eliminated for failing OPS hazard/restart criteria

---

## Elimination Criteria (Applied Strictly)

A material is **ELIMINATED** if ANY of the following are true:

1. **Primarily Aromatic/Perfumery:** Material's primary historical use was fragrance/perfumery
2. **Culinary or Alimentary:** Material's primary historical use was food/beverage
3. **Easily Replaceable:** Base materials cheap and abundantly available
4. **Economically Scaled:** Historical practice was commercial/production-oriented
5. **Safe to Discard Mid-Process:** Batch failure tolerated without catastrophe
6. **Endpoint-Defined:** Process has defined completion criteria (not indefinite)
7. **Short Duration:** Processing time measured in hours to days (not weeks/months)

---

## Eliminated Materials

### 1. Aromatic Waters (Rose Water, Lavender Water, Orange Flower Water)

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Category | 🌿 Botanical |
| Associated Process | Hydrodistillation |
| Status | **ELIMINATED** |

#### Elimination Rationale

**Primary Reason: Primarily Aromatic/Perfumery**

Aromatic waters are definitionally perfumery products. Their entire purpose is fragrance.

**Secondary Reason: Commercial Scale Production**

Historical evidence from Damascus (13th century) and Brunschwig (1500) shows multi-unit production plants. This is commercial-scale, throughput-valued production.

| Historical Evidence | Assessment |
|---------------------|------------|
| Damascus manuscripts (13th c.) | Multi-unit production plants |
| Brunschwig (1500) | Systematic production methods |
| Iran production (historical) | 90% of world supply |

**Tertiary Reason: Trivial Restart**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Processing time | 4-6 hours per batch |
| Restart requirement | Add new rose petals |
| Material cost | Abundant during harvest season |
| Batch failure tolerance | HIGH |

Rose petals must be distilled the same day they are picked. This means:
- Material is seasonally available in quantity
- Individual batch failures are tolerable
- Restart means starting a new batch, not losing accumulated work

**Doctrine Failures:**

| Principle | Aromatic Waters | Verdict |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| P3: Restart requires low engagement | NO - restart trivial | ❌ FAIL |
| P5: Throughput transient | NO - commercial production values throughput | ❌ FAIL |

**Verdict:** ELIMINATED for being primarily aromatic/perfumery, commercial scale, trivial restart, and P3/P5 doctrine failures.

### 2. Essential Oils

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Category | 🌿 Botanical |
| Associated Process | Hydrodistillation, Cohobation |
| Status | **ELIMINATED** |

#### Elimination Rationale

**Primary Reason: Primarily Aromatic/Perfumery**

Essential oils are concentrated aromatic compounds. Their purpose is fragrance.

**Secondary Reason: Batch-Compatible Economics**

While cohobation was used for essential oil concentration, the process is:
- Batch-oriented (discrete runs)
- Restartable with fresh material
- Measured in hours to days, not weeks

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Processing time | Hours to days |
| Restart cost | Loss of one batch |
| Material availability | Seasonal but abundant |

**Tertiary Reason: Endpoint-Defined**

Essential oil extraction has defined endpoints:
- Yield diminishing returns
- Color/clarity markers
- Sensory completion criteria

This is INCOMPATIBLE with OPS structure (0 endpoint markers).

**Verdict:** ELIMINATED for being primarily aromatic/perfumery, endpoint-defined, and short duration.

---

### 3. Frankincense/Myrrh Preparations

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Category | 🌿 Botanical (Resin) |
| Associated Process | Distillation, Maceration |
| Status | **ELIMINATED** |

#### Elimination Rationale

**Primary Reason: Primarily Aromatic/Perfumery**

Frankincense and myrrh are aromatic resins. Historical uses include incense, perfumery, and medicine, but the primary character is aromatic.

**Secondary Reason: Moderate Duration Only**

While alchemical/astrodynamic preparations may follow lunar cycles (4-8 weeks), this is:
- Primarily symbolic/astrological timing
- Not driven by process necessity
- Standard distillation is hours to days

| Method | Duration |
|--------|----------|
| Hydrodistillation | Hours |
| Astrodynamic maceration | 4-8 weeks (symbolic) |

**Tertiary Reason: Restart Tolerable**

Frankincense/myrrh resins are:
- Relatively expensive but not catastrophically so
- Available through trade (not rare)
- Batch failure loses material value, not weeks of accumulated work

**Verdict:** ELIMINATED for being primarily aromatic and having tolerable restart economics.

---

### 4. Simple Aqua Vitae (Distilled Wine)

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Category | 🌿 Botanical |
| Associated Process | Single Distillation |
| Status | **ELIMINATED** |

#### Elimination Rationale

**Note:** This material was already eliminated in EXT-3. Documented here for completeness.

**Primary Reason: Cheap Base Material**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Base material | Wine (abundant, cheap) |
| Restart cost | One batch of wine |
| Economic barrier | MINIMAL |

**Secondary Reason: Standardization**

Taddeo Alderotti (1276) and Michele Savonarola (1440s) systematized aqua vitae production, introducing procedural elements that reduced expert burden.

**Tertiary Reason: Short Duration**

Single distillation takes hours, not weeks.

**Verdict:** ELIMINATED for cheap base material, standardization, and short duration. (Confirmed from EXT-3)

---

### 5. Medicinal Herb Waters

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Category | 🌿 Botanical |
| Associated Process | Hydrodistillation |
| Status | **ELIMINATED** |

#### Elimination Rationale

**Primary Reason: Batch-Compatible Economics**

Medicinal herb waters are produced in batches with:
- Abundant material (cultivated or gathered herbs)
- Short processing time (hours)
- Tolerable batch failure

**Secondary Reason: Standardized Recipes**

Apothecary practice included standardized recipes for medicinal waters. This implies:
- Procedural control (not expert judgment)
- Endpoint-defined completion
- Reproducibility valued

**Tertiary Reason: Recoverable Failures**

Many medicinal herb water failures are recoverable:
- Weak concentration: add more herbs, redistill
- Contamination: filter or restart
- Thermal degradation: less yield, but not catastrophic

This is INCOMPATIBLE with OPS P2 (Escalation Is Irreversible).

**Verdict:** ELIMINATED for batch-compatible economics, standardization, and recoverable failures.

---

### 6. Turpentine Distillates

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Category | 🌿 Botanical |
| Associated Process | Distillation |
| Status | **ELIMINATED** |

#### Elimination Rationale

**Primary Reason: Industrial/Commercial Use**

Turpentine was extracted primarily for:
- Solvent applications
- Paint/varnish production
- Industrial uses

This is commercial-scale, throughput-valued production.

**Secondary Reason: Cheap Material**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Source | Pine resin (abundant) |
| Restart cost | Fresh resin |
| Processing time | Hours |

**Tertiary Reason: Short Duration**

Turpentine distillation is measured in hours, not weeks.

**Verdict:** ELIMINATED for industrial use, cheap material, and short duration.

---

### 7. Quintessence of Wine (7-Fold Redistillation)

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Category | 🌿 Botanical |
| Associated Process | Circulatio (7-fold) |
| Status | **ELIMINATED** |

#### Elimination Rationale

**Note:** This is a BORDERLINE case. Quintessence circulation in EXT-3 survived because of multi-pass investment. However, EXT-4 applies material-level criteria.

**Primary Reason: Cheap Base Material**

Wine is the base material. While 7-fold redistillation creates accumulating investment, the BASE material is cheap.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Base material | Wine (cheap) |
| Accumulated investment | TIME, not material |
| Restart cost | Lose time (days-weeks), not expensive material |

**Distinguishing from Mineral Survivors:**

| Factor | Quintessence of Wine | Aurum Potabile |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| Base material cost | LOW (wine) | EXTREME (gold) |
| Duration | Days to weeks | Months |
| Material lost on restart | Wine (cheap) | Gold (expensive) |
| Hazard profile | Flammable | Toxic, corrosive |

**Secondary Reason: Rupescissa's Dual Purpose**

John of Rupescissa described quintessence of wine as a PRECURSOR—the medium for dissolving gold, antimony, and other substances. The wine itself is not the product; it is the solvent.

This means the valuable work is:
- Gold dissolution (months)
- Antimony extraction (weeks)
- NOT the wine distillation itself

**Verdict:** ELIMINATED as base material; quintessence of GOLD and quintessence of ANTIMONY survive as separate materials.

---

### 8. Common Botanicals (Herbs, Flowers, Leaves)

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Category | 🌿 Botanical |
| Associated Process | Various |
| Status | **ELIMINATED** |

#### Elimination Rationale

**Primary Reason: Easily Replaceable**

Common botanical materials are:
- Cultivated or wild-gathered
- Seasonally abundant
- Cheap to obtain

**Secondary Reason: Short Duration**

Most botanical processing is measured in hours to days.

**Tertiary Reason: Restart Trivial**

Restart means: gather more herbs, start again.

**Verdict:** ELIMINATED for being easily replaceable and short duration.

---

### 9. Resin Extracts (Non-Aromatic)

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Category | 🌿 Botanical |
| Associated Process | Distillation, Maceration |
| Status | **ELIMINATED** |

#### Elimination Rationale

**Primary Reason: Endpoint-Defined**

Resin extraction has defined endpoints:
- Yield exhaustion
- Color/clarity markers
- Viscosity changes

This is INCOMPATIBLE with OPS structure (0 endpoint markers).

**Secondary Reason: Moderate Restart Cost**

Resins are more expensive than herbs but not catastrophically so. Restart loses material value, not accumulated transformation work.

**Verdict:** ELIMINATED for endpoint-defined processing and moderate restart cost.

---

## Statistical Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Materials evaluated | 15 |
| Materials eliminated | 9 |
| Elimination rate | **60%** |
| Botanical materials evaluated | 9 |
| Botanical materials eliminated | **9 (100%)** |

---

## Key Finding

**ALL botanical materials are eliminated.** The OPS hazard/restart profile is INCOMPATIBLE with botanical processing.

The key discriminators are:
1. **Duration:** Botanical processing is hours-days; OPS implies weeks-months
2. **Material cost:** Botanical materials are cheap; OPS implies expensive materials
3. **Restart catastrophe:** Botanical restart is tolerable; OPS implies catastrophic restart
4. **Hazard profile:** Botanical hazards are moderate; OPS implies extreme (toxic, corrosive)
