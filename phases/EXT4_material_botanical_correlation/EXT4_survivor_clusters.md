## Survivor Overview

| Tier | Count | Materials |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Tier 2 (Full) | 4 | Philosophical Mercury, Antimony Preparations, Aurum Potabile, Mercurial Elixirs |

## Process-Material Clusters

### Cluster 1: MERCURIAL PREPARATIONS

**Associated EXT-3 Process:** Circulatio, Cohobatio, Athanor Digestion

| Material | Process Variant | Duration | Key Hazards |
|----------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| Philosophical Mercury | Sublimation + Digestion | Weeks-Months | Toxic, Volatile, Phase-sensitive |
| Mercurial Elixirs | Athanor Digestion | 40+ days | Mercury poisoning |
| Corrosive Sublimate | Cohobatio + Sublimation | Weeks | Corrosive crystals |

**Common Properties:**
- Mercury as base or key component
- Extreme toxicity (irreversible neurological damage)
- Phase-ordering hazards dominant (vapor vs solid vs liquid)
- Restart catastrophic (apparatus contaminated, weeks/months lost)

**Historical Context:**
- Pseudo-Geber *Summa Perfectionis* (~1300)
- *Liber de aluminibus et salibus* (13th c.)
- Chinese elixir tradition (documented casualties)
- Court alchemists under imperial/royal patronage

**OPS Alignment:**
- PHASE_ORDERING (41%): Mercury sublimation is phase-order critical
- COMPOSITION_JUMP (24%): Impurity ruins batch
- CONTAINMENT_TIMING (24%): Vapor escape is catastrophic
- ENERGY_OVERSHOOT (6%): Overheating volatilizes mercury
- RATE_MISMATCH (6%): Sublimation rate must match condensation

### Cluster 2: ANTIMONY PREPARATIONS

**Associated EXT-3 Process:** Athanor Digestion, Cohobatio

| Material | Process Variant | Duration | Key Hazards |
|----------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| Stibnite (Sb₂S₃) | Calcination + Digestion | Weeks | Toxic, Phase-sensitive |
| Kermes Mineral | Oxidation + Digestion | Weeks | Toxic, Composition-critical |
| Regulus of Antimony | Reduction + Digestion | Days-Weeks | Toxic |

**Common Properties:**
- Antimony as base element
- High toxicity (skin absorption, ingestion)
- Composition-jump hazards (sulfide ↔ oxide transitions critical)
- Color changes indicate correct progression

**Historical Context:**
- John of Rupescissa (~1351): Quintessence of antimony
- Pseudo-Geber *Summa Perfectionis* (14th c.)
- Eirenaeus Philalethes/George Starkey (17th c.)
- "Basil Valentine" tradition

**OPS Alignment:**
- COMPOSITION_JUMP (24%): Sulfide/oxide balance is critical
- PHASE_ORDERING (41%): Calcination sequence matters
- ENERGY_OVERSHOOT (6%): Overcalcination destroys batch
- CONTAINMENT_TIMING (24%): Sulfur escape during calcination

### Cluster 3: GOLD PREPARATIONS

**Associated EXT-3 Process:** Circulatio, Quintessence Operations

| Material | Process Variant | Duration | Key Hazards |
|----------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| Aurum Potabile | Circulatio + Digestion | Months | Gold contamination, Toxic additives |
| Gold Quintessence | Multi-pass Circulatio | Months | Gold loss, Long duration |

**Common Properties:**
- Gold as base material (EXPENSIVE)
- Extreme restart cost (gold is not replaceable cheaply)
- Months of accumulated work
- "Philosophical mercury" as solvent (toxic)

**Historical Context:**
- George Ripley *Compound of Alchemy* (1471)
- Francis Anthony (1550-1603): Medical aurum potabile
- Paracelsian tradition: "medicamenta comfortativa"
- Royal College of Physicians prosecution

**OPS Alignment:**
- COMPOSITION_JUMP (24%): Gold contamination destroys value
- CONTAINMENT_TIMING (24%): Loss of dissolved gold is catastrophic
- PHASE_ORDERING (41%): Dissolution/precipitation sequence critical
- Restart CATASTROPHIC: Gold is expensive, months of work lost

---

### Cluster 4: CORROSIVE ACIDS (Marginal)

**Associated EXT-3 Process:** Cohobatio, Distillation

| Material | Process Variant | Duration | Key Hazards |
|----------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| Oil of Vitriol | Distillation from green vitriol | Days-Weeks | Extremely corrosive |
| Sal Ammoniac | Putrefaction + Digestion + Sublimation | 2-3 Months | Corrosive on sublimation |

**Common Properties:**
- Corrosive rather than toxic
- Duration variable (weeks to months)
- Apparatus damage on failure
- Less expensive base materials

**Why Marginal:**
- Duration meets threshold for sal ammoniac
- BUT base materials are cheap (urine, vitriol crystals)
- Restart loses time, not expensive materials
- Corrosive but not as lethal as mercurial cluster

**OPS Alignment:**
- CONTAINMENT_TIMING (24%): Acid/vapor escape is dangerous
- ENERGY_OVERSHOOT (6%): Overheating can cause splattering
- Phase-ordering less critical than mercurial cluster

## Cluster Comparison

| Property | Mercurial | Antimony | Gold | Acids (Marginal) |
|----------|-----------|----------|------|------------------|
| Base Element | Mercury | Antimony | Gold | Sulfur, Ammonia |
| Toxicity | LETHAL | HIGH | MODERATE | CORROSIVE |
| Duration | Weeks-Months | Weeks | Months | Days-Months |
| Material Cost | HIGH | MODERATE | EXTREME | LOW |
| Restart Cost | CATASTROPHIC | HIGH | CATASTROPHIC | MODERATE |
| Historical Context | Court alchemy | Medical alchemy | Paracelsian | Industrial |

## Cross-Cluster Properties

### What ALL Survivors Share

1. **Mineral Origin:** All survivors are mineral/metallic, not botanical
2. **Toxicity/Corrosivity:** All survivors are dangerous to handle
3. **Expert Context:** All were guild-restricted or court-sponsored
4. **Extended Duration:** All require weeks to months (not hours/days)
5. **Irreversible Failure:** All failures destroy accumulated work

### What Separates Tiers

| Tier 2 (Full Survivors) | Tier 3 (Marginal) |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Expensive base materials | Cheap base materials |
| Lethal toxicity | Corrosive but less lethal |
| Months of work | Weeks of work (acids) |
| Apparatus contamination | Apparatus damage |

---

## The Unified Material Space

The survivor cluster represents a **SINGLE coherent material space**:

> **ALCHEMICAL-MEDICAL MINERAL PREPARATIONS**
>
> Characterized by:
> - Mercury, antimony, or gold as base/key component
> - Toxic/corrosive hazard profile
> - Weeks to months processing duration
> - Catastrophic restart economics
> - Expert-only, guild-restricted context

### NOT in the survivor space:
- Aromatic waters
- Essential oils
- Botanical extracts
- Culinary preparations
- Commercial-scale products
- Any botanical material

---

## What This Does NOT Establish

- **NO products identified:** Survivors describe material classes, not specific outputs
- **NO recipes specified:** What was made from these materials is not determined
- **NO illustrations interpreted:** Visual content not used
- **NO Voynich text decoded:** This is external comparison only

---

## Relationship to EXT-3 Processes

| EXT-3 Process | EXT-4 Survivor Cluster |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Circulatio | Aurum Potabile, Mercurial preparations |
| Cohobatio | Philosophical Mercury, Antimony, (Acids) |
| Athanor Digestion | Mercurial Elixirs, Antimony, (Sal Ammoniac) |
| Quintessence Operations | Gold Quintessence |

All four EXT-3 processes map to the unified mineral material space.

## Implications for Voynich Interpretation

### What EXT-4 Rules OUT

1. **Aromatic waters** as the manuscript's subject (PIAA/PIA conclusion challenged)
2. **Perfumery** as the primary context
3. **Commercial production** as the operational setting
4. **Botanical materials** as the subject matter
5. **Household/apothecary** scale operations

### What EXT-4 Suggests

1. **Alchemical-medical** context (mercury, gold, antimony preparations)
2. **Expert guild-level** operation (not commercial, not household)
3. **Court or private** sponsorship (expensive materials, extended durations)
4. **Toxic/dangerous** materials (matching OPS hazard severity)
5. **Extended operations** (weeks to months, matching philosophical month)

## Confidence Assessment

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Botanical materials eliminated | HIGH | All fail hazard/restart criteria |
| Mineral materials survive | HIGH | All meet hazard/restart criteria |
| Survivor space is coherent | HIGH | Single material family |
| Aromatic interpretation challenged | HIGH | OPS severity incompatible |
| Alchemical-medical context suggested | MODERATE | Historical alignment, not proof |
