# EXT-4 Revision Notice: Duration Criterion Invalidated

**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Status:** PARTIAL INVALIDATION
**Triggered By:** SID-05 (Attentional Pacing Discrimination) + EXT-ECO-01 (Opportunity-Loss Hazard Profile)

---

## Summary

EXT-4's elimination of ALL botanical materials was based on a duration criterion that has been invalidated by subsequent analysis. Botanical materials are **BACK ON THE POSSIBILITY LIST**.

---

## The Original EXT-4 Argument

EXT-4 eliminated botanical materials using this logic:

| Criterion | Threshold | Botanical Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| Duration | Weeks to months required | Hours to days → FAIL |
| Restart Cost | Catastrophic (weeks of work lost) | Trivial (new batch) → FAIL |
| Material Economics | Expensive/scarce | Cheap/abundant → FAIL |

**Conclusion:** "The OPS hazard topology implies weeks-to-months duration. Botanical processing takes hours-to-days. Therefore, botanicals are INCOMPATIBLE."

---

## Why This Argument Is Now Invalid

### SID-05 Findings (Attentional Pacing)

SID-05 tested what the human-track residue layer encodes. Result: **attentional pacing** - marks made to maintain focus during waiting phases.

| Finding | z-score / Effect | Implication |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Variability suppresses near hazards | z=22 | Operator is PRESENT during hazards |
| Position-independent | r=0.017 | Not tracking location over long absences |
| Boundary reset | 17.6% vs 0% | Attention resets at sections, not calendar time |
| Simpler morphology near hazards | d=0.33 | Automatic writing while monitoring |

**This describes hours of active monitoring, NOT weeks of periodic checking.**

### EXT-ECO-01 Findings (Opportunity-Loss Profile)

EXT-ECO-01 tested whether hazards encode physical instability or economic loss.

| Finding | Value | Implication |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Premature hazards | 64.7% | "Acting before ready" dominates |
| Late hazards | 0% | "Waiting too long" never punished |
| Wait dominance | 37.6% LINK | Patience is the strategy |
| No risk-reward | margin -0.158, speed +0.003 | Aggression has no payoff |

**This describes opportunity-loss through impatience, NOT physical catastrophe from slow processes.**

---

## Revised Duration Interpretation

| What EXT-4 Assumed | What Evidence Actually Shows |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| "Weeks to months" of operation | Hours of concentrated attention |
| Periodic check-ins on slow process | Continuous monitoring during run |
| Time investment creates fear | Attention investment creates fear |
| Restart loses accumulated calendar time | Restart loses this batch (perishable material) |

---

## Botanical Reconsideration

### Rose Water Distillation (Previously Eliminated)

| Factor | EXT-4 Assessment | Revised Assessment |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Duration | 4-6 hours → TOO SHORT | 4-6 hours of ACTIVE ATTENTION |
| Restart cost | Trivial (new petals) | Catastrophic (today's petals are tomorrow's garbage) |
| Hazard type | LOW | OPPORTUNITY-LOSS (premature opening ruins batch) |
| Waiting | Not valued | ESSENTIAL (patience is the only strategy) |

**Rose petals must be distilled the day they're picked.** If you ruin a batch, you don't just "get more petals" - you've lost that day's harvest. The next batch requires waiting for more flowers.

### Essential Oils (Previously Eliminated)

| Factor | EXT-4 Assessment | Revised Assessment |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Duration | Hours to days → TOO SHORT | Hours of concentrated monitoring |
| Endpoint | Defined (sensory) | Undefined in TEXT (operator judges) |
| Restart | Tolerable | Loss of concentrated material + time |

### Frankincense/Myrrh (Previously Eliminated)

| Factor | EXT-4 Assessment | Revised Assessment |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Duration | Days to weeks | Still compatible |
| Symbolic timing | Dismissed as "astrological" | May reflect actual process requirements |
| Restart | Tolerable | Expensive resins + time lost |

---

## What Remains Valid in EXT-4

The following EXT-4 findings are NOT invalidated:

1. **Mineral materials survive** - Mercury, antimony, gold preparations still fit all criteria
2. **Toxicity correlation** - High-hazard materials correlate with toxic/corrosive substances
3. **Expert context** - Guild-restricted knowledge requirement still holds
4. **Process linkage** - Circulatio, cohobatio, digestion still match

## Revised Material Status

| Material Class | EXT-4 Status | Revised Status |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Philosophical Mercury | ✅ Survives | ✅ Survives |
| Antimony Preparations | ✅ Survives | ✅ Survives |
| Aurum Potabile | ✅ Survives | ✅ Survives |
| Mercurial Elixirs | ✅ Survives | ✅ Survives |
| Sal Ammoniac | ⚠️ Marginal | ⚠️ Marginal |
| Oil of Vitriol | ⚠️ Marginal | ⚠️ Marginal |
| Aromatic Waters | ❌ Eliminated | ⚠️ **RECONSIDERED** |
| Essential Oils | ❌ Eliminated | ⚠️ **RECONSIDERED** |
| Frankincense/Myrrh | ❌ Eliminated | ⚠️ **RECONSIDERED** |
| Medicinal Herb Waters | ❌ Eliminated | ⚠️ **RECONSIDERED** |
| Simple Aqua Vitae | ❌ Eliminated | ❌ Remains eliminated (cheap, standardized) |
| Turpentine Distillates | ❌ Eliminated | ❌ Remains eliminated (industrial) |
| Common Botanicals | ❌ Eliminated | ⚠️ **RECONSIDERED** |

## Revised Conclusion

**The duration criterion that eliminated botanical materials was based on a false premise.**

The OPS hazard structure does NOT imply weeks-to-months duration. It implies:
- High-stakes attention during active runs
- Opportunity-loss through premature action
- Binary failure (batch ruined, not recoverable)
- Patience as the only viable strategy

These characteristics are EQUALLY CONSISTENT with:
- 4-6 hour rose water distillation (perishable material, one chance per day)
- Multi-hour essential oil extraction (concentration requires patience)
- Extended aromatic cohobation (quality requires waiting)

**Botanical materials are BACK ON THE POSSIBILITY LIST.**

Both mineral/alchemical AND botanical/aromatic interpretations now survive the constraint battery.

## Implications for Product Identification

| Prior Status | Revised Status |
|--------------|----------------|
| Aromatic waters ELIMINATED | Aromatic waters RECONSIDERED |
| Only mineral materials survive | Both mineral AND botanical survive |
| Alchemical-medical interpretation dominant | Aromatic interpretation VIABLE |

The manuscript may encode:
- Alchemical mineral preparations (mercury, antimony, gold)
- OR aromatic botanical extractions (rose water, essential oils)
- OR both (multi-purpose workshop)

**Internal analysis cannot distinguish between these possibilities.**
