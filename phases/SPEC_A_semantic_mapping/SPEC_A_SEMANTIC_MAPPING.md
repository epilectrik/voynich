## EPISTEMIC WARNING

**This document contains SPECULATIVE interpretations.** Nothing here constitutes a constraint or proven finding. These are plausible mappings based on structural patterns, offered for consideration only.

The structural facts are Tier 2. The semantic labels are Tier 4.

## Structural Foundation

### What We Know (Tier 2)

Currier A encodes a compositional classification system:

```
token = [ARTICULATOR] + PREFIX + [MIDDLE] + SUFFIX
```

| Component | Count | Coverage |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| PREFIX | 8 families | Required |
| MIDDLE | 42+ forms | Optional |
| SUFFIX | 5 families (19 forms) | Required |
| ARTICULATOR | ~9 forms | Optional |

This yields 897 observed combinations and ~1,800 catalog entries.

## Speculative PREFIX Meanings

### Structural Signatures

| PREFIX | Frequency | Section | Top Suffix | Middle Diversity | Signature |
|--------|-----------|---------|------------|------------------|-----------|
| CH | 7,181 (30%) | H 75% | -ol | 422 (highest) | Universal mixer |
| DA | 3,619 (15%) | H 72% | -daiin (55%) | 151 | Self-referential |
| QO | 3,449 (14%) | H 69% | -ol | 261 | k-middle (26%) |
| SH | 3,303 (14%) | H 75% | -ol | 215 | o-middle (24%) |
| OK | 1,905 (8%) | H 55% | -y | 136 | Most distributed |
| OT | 1,640 (7%) | H 73% | -ol | 136 | ch-middle (30%) |
| CT | 1,492 (6%) | H 86% | -hy (28%) | 91 (lowest) | Most concentrated |
| OL | 853 (4%) | H 53% | -ol (43%) | 91 | Self-referential |

### Proposed Semantic Mapping

**If this is an aromatic/botanical classification system:**

| PREFIX | Speculative Meaning | Rationale |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| **CH** | COMMON HERBS | Highest frequency (30%), universal mixer (appears in all top prefix pairs), highest middle diversity (422). The "default" or most versatile category. |
| **DA** | BASE MATERIALS | Dominated by -daiin suffix (55%). DA+daiin forms the structural primitive. Possibly vehicles, carriers, or foundational materials. |
| **QO** | PROCESSED MATERIALS | Strong k-middle preference (26%). The "k" component may indicate a processing step or refinement. |
| **SH** | AROMATIC PLANTS | Strong o-middle preference (24%). Structurally distinct from CH despite similar section distribution. |
| **CT** | FRESH/RAW MATERIALS | Highest section concentration (86% H), lowest middle diversity (91), strong -hy suffix preference. Most "plant-specific" category. |
| **OT** | DERIVED PRODUCTS | Strong ch-middle (30%) suggests derivation from CH family. Secondary/compound category. |
| **OK** | CROSS-DOMAIN ITEMS | Most evenly distributed across sections (55% H). Universal applicability suggests quality grades or common additives. |
| **OL** | LIQUID PREPARATIONS | Self-referential (-ol suffix 43%), most P-distributed (39%). May mark liquid forms or prepared solutions. |

### Alternative Mapping (Processing States)

| PREFIX | Alternative Meaning |
|--------|---------------------|
| CH | Dried/prepared |
| DA | Measured/portioned |
| QO | Extracted |
| SH | Distilled |
| CT | Fresh/raw |
| OT | Compounded |
| OK | Quality-graded |
| OL | Liquid form |

## Speculative SUFFIX Meanings

### Structural Signatures

| Family | Count | % | Section Pattern | Key Association |
|--------|-------|---|-----------------|-----------------|
| -y family | 11,931 | 39% | H-dominant (70-93%) | Processing states |
| -l family | 6,553 | 21% | -eol P-specific (56%) | Liquid forms |
| -iin family | 5,712 | 19% | DA-concentrated | Unit/measure |
| -r family | 5,609 | 18% | Even distribution | Source variants |
| -m family | 1,043 | 3% | Rare | Special conditions |

### Proposed Semantic Mapping

| Suffix Family | Speculative Meaning | Rationale |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **-y family** | PROCESSING STATE | Largest family (39%), most variants (7). Different -y endings may encode drying stages, quality grades, or preparation methods. -chy (93% H) may be "raw/fresh," -hy may be "processed." |
| **-l family** | PREPARATION FORM | -ol is universal (liquid?), -eol is P-specific (pharmaceutical preparation?), -al may be "alternative form." |
| **-iin family** | QUANTITY/UNIT | Concentrated in DA prefix. -daiin as structural primitive may mark "standard unit" or "base portion." |
| **-r family** | SOURCE/ORIGIN | Even distribution suggests variant marking. -or/-ar/-eor may distinguish geographic origin, harvest season, or supplier. |
| **-m family** | SPECIAL CONDITION | Rarest family (3%). May mark exceptional items, aged materials, or special handling requirements. |

### Specific Suffix Proposals

| Suffix | Speculative Meaning |
|--------|---------------------|
| -ol | Standard liquid/oil form |
| -eol | Pharmaceutical preparation (P-specific) |
| -al | Alternative/variant form |
| -or | Primary source |
| -ar | Secondary source |
| -eor | Extended/aged source |
| -y | Basic dried form |
| -ey | Enhanced dried form |
| -hy | Heat-processed |
| -chy | Fresh/unprocessed |
| -dy | Standard dry |
| -ody | Oil-dried |
| -daiin | Standard unit/measure |
| -aiin | Alternative unit |
| -ain | Partial unit |
| -am | Special/aged |
| -om | Rare condition |

## Speculative MIDDLE Meanings

The MIDDLE component shows prefix-specific patterns:

| PREFIX | Dominant Middle | Speculative Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CT | -h- (65%) | CT-h- = fresh + basic state |
| OT | -ch- (30%) | OT-ch- = derived from CH |
| QO | -k- (26%) | QO-k- = processed + technique marker |
| SH | -o- (24%) | SH-o- = aromatic + oil-related |
| OK | -e- (22%) | OK-e- = quality + grade indicator |
| CH | -e- (9%) | Highly diverse, no dominant pattern |

The MIDDLE appears to encode sub-classifications within each PREFIX family.

## Section Mapping

| Section | Traditional Name | Token Profile | Speculative Function |
|---------|------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| H | Herbal | 70% of tokens, CT concentrated (86%), -chy concentrated (93%) | RAW MATERIAL CATALOG - Classification of botanical inputs |
| P | Pharmaceutical | -eol concentrated (56%), OK/OL elevated | PREPARATION CATALOG - Processed forms and formulations |
| T | Text/Other | Most diverse suffix distribution, -ar/-al elevated | VARIANT CATALOG - Special cases, alternatives, notes |

---

## Complete Token Interpretation Examples

Using the speculative mapping:

| Token | Decomposition | Speculative Reading |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| chol | CH + ol | Common herb, liquid form |
| chor | CH + or | Common herb, primary source |
| daiin | DA + iin | Base material, standard unit |
| cthy | CT + h + y | Fresh material, basic state, dried |
| qokol | QO + k + ol | Processed, technique-marked, liquid |
| shol | SH + ol | Aromatic plant, liquid form |
| okeol | OK + e + ol | Quality-graded, enhanced, pharmaceutical |

---

## Catalog Entry Interpretation

A typical Currier A entry with repetition:

```
[chol, chol, chol] = 3x
```

Speculative reading: "Three units of common herb in liquid form"

A mixed entry:
```
[chol, daiin, shol, qokol]
```

Speculative reading: "Common herb liquid + base unit + aromatic liquid + processed liquid" — possibly a compound recipe or formulation record.

---

## Compatibility with Historical Context

This mapping is **compatible with** but **not proven by** the aromatic workshop hypothesis:

1. **8 material categories** — Reasonable for botanical classification (flowers, herbs, roots, seeds, bark, resins, fruits, compounds)

2. **5 form variants** — Matches historical preparation types (waters, oils, powders, dried, special)

3. **Section organization** — Raw materials (H) → Preparations (P) → Variants (T)

4. **Scale (~1,800 entries)** — Consistent with major institutional operations (Santa Maria Novella, Venetian muschieri)

---

## What This Does NOT Claim

- Specific botanical identifications (CH ≠ "chamomile")
- Exact processing methods
- Product names or prices
- Natural language equivalents
- Translation of any token

---

## Testing This Hypothesis

This speculative mapping could be strengthened or weakened by:

### Would Strengthen:
- Finding historical botanical catalogs with similar 8-category structure
- Discovering 15th c. aromatic classification schemes matching this pattern
- Identifying suffix patterns in known pharmaceutical inventories

### Would Weaken:
- Finding the 8-prefix pattern is arbitrary (no historical parallel)
- Discovering suffix families don't correspond to preparation types
- Evidence that sections don't map to raw→prepared→variant

---

## Verdict

**Tier 4 SPECULATIVE** — This mapping is structurally plausible and historically compatible, but entirely unproven. It provides a framework for thinking about what Currier A might encode, not a decipherment.

The structural analysis is sound. The semantic labels are informed speculation.
