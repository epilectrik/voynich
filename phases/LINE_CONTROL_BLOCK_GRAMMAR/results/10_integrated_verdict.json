  "verdict_description": "Token-level grammar exists for some phenomena",
  "narrative": "Positional token exclusivity is real (192/334 tokens zone-exclusive, 2.7x shuffle), but the negative control shows this is primarily structural (role/position driven). Half the exclusivity survives suffix-stripping, indicating both stem and suffix contribute. Token-level bigram constraints exist: 26 mandatory bigrams and 9 forbidden, including 2 genuinely token-specific forbidden bigrams (chey->chedy, chey->shedy, both ENERGY class). Again, the negative control indicates this is mostly structural. Line length is strongly determined by the opener: opener class adds 24.9% partial R-squared beyond folio+regime. The opener+folio combination explains 93.7% of length variance. This is the strongest token-level finding. Opener role modestly predicts line body (29.2% accuracy, 1.46x chance), but specific opener tokens add nothing beyond their role. The opener is a role marker, not an instruction header. Boundary vocabularies are NOT concentrated into small closed sets (Gini 0.47, below 0.60). Opening and closing positions draw from nearly the full vocabulary. Within-zone token ordering is random. EN and AX tokens in the WORK zone show no systematic sequence (tau ~ 0, p ~ 0.5). Phases (KERNEL/LINK/FL) show weak clustering (alternation below shuffle, p<0.001) but not sequential blocking. KERNEL->FL and LINK->FL show moderate ordering (~0.63). Phases are tendencies, not strict sequences. Paragraph body lines are compositionally homogeneous. The only progression is line shortening (rho=-0.23). After length control, no compositional features survive. Bigram grammar varies by zone: boundaries show strong zone-specific patterns (KL=1.05 bits at INITIAL), but only early-medial zone is significant vs shuffle. Core zone matches global.",
  "architectural_interpretation": "Currier B lines operate as BOUNDARY-CONSTRAINED control blocks with a FREE interior. The opener and closer positions carry role-level constraints that shape line length and boundary bigrams, but the WORK zone (medial positions) is role-governed without additional token-level syntax. Token identity matters at boundaries (positional exclusivity, mandatory bigrams) but this is primarily structural \u2014 driven by which ROLES can open/close lines, not which specific tokens. The system is essentially role-complete: the 49 instruction classes and 5 roles capture nearly all syntactic structure, with token-level effects emerging as consequences of role membership rather than independent grammatical constraints.",
