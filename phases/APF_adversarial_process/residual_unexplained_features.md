# Residual Unexplained Features

> **PURPOSE**: Features that NEITHER archetype explains well

---

## Features Unexplained by BOTH Archetypes

### 1. Three Restart-Capable Programs (f50v, f57r, f82v)

- **PF-E tension**: Too few for batch extraction (expects many restart points)
- **PF-C tension**: Why restart at all if maintaining? (expects zero)
- **Possible resolution**: Hybrid interpretation (extraction + conditioning phases)
- **Residual mystery level**: MODERATE

### 2. AGGRESSIVE Program Subset (18.1%)

- **PF-E tension**: Extraction wants speed, but grammar prioritizes safety
- **PF-C tension**: Maintenance shouldn't flirt with hazard limits
- **Possible resolution**: Distinct operational mode (startup? recovery from fault?)
- **Residual mystery level**: HIGH

### 3. Five Distinct Hazard Classes

- **PF-E expects**: COMPOSITION_JUMP, RATE_MISMATCH dominance
- **PF-C expects**: PHASE_ORDERING, CONTAINMENT_TIMING dominance
- **Observed**: All 5 equally present across all programs
- **Possible resolution**: Multi-modal process with diverse failure modes
- **Residual mystery level**: MODERATE

### 4. Kernel Dominance Pattern (k > h > e)

- **PF-E**: Doesn't predict specific operator hierarchy
- **PF-C**: Doesn't predict specific operator hierarchy
- **Observed**: k (ENERGY_MODULATOR) is consistently most central
- **Possible resolution**: Thermal control is primary; both archetypes may involve heat
- **Residual mystery level**: LOW (energy centrality is generic)

### 5. 9.8x Vocabulary Compression

- **PF-E**: Doesn't predict specific compression ratio
- **PF-C**: Doesn't predict specific compression ratio
- **Observed**: 480 tokens reduced to 49 equivalence classes
- **Possible resolution**: Cognitive load optimization (human factors, not process type)
- **Residual mystery level**: LOW (design choice, not process signature)

## Features Each Archetype ALONE Struggles With

### PF-E Unique Struggles

| Feature | Why It's Hard |
|---------|---------------|
| 0 endpoint markers | Extraction is inherently finite |
| 100% bidirectional hazards | Extraction is irreversible |
| 4.8% ULTRA_CONSERVATIVE | No extraction purpose |
| High-LINK = safer | Speed-safety tradeoff violated |

### PF-C Unique Struggles

| Feature | Why It's Hard |
|---------|---------------|
| 83 distinct programs | Pure maintenance should be uniform |
| 16.9% LINK_SPARSE | Maintenance should wait |
| 12% HIGH_INTERVENTION | Active change, not passive maintenance |
| f57r = RESTART_PROTOCOL | Maintenance shouldn't need resets |

## Synthesis: What Process Family Would Explain Everything?

The ideal archetype would need to:

1. **Operate indefinitely** (like conditioning) — explains 0 endpoints
2. **Vary by substrate/condition** (like extraction) — explains 83 programs
3. **Prioritize safety over speed** — explains conservative dominance
4. **Tolerate diverse failure modes** — explains 5 hazard classes
5. **Include rare reset capability** — explains 3 restart programs
6. **Use waiting as stability mechanism** — explains LINK behavior
7. **Converge to stable state** — explains 100% STATE-C convergence

### Candidate Synthesis: CONTINUOUS CIRCULATION MAINTENANCE

A process that:
- Circulates material indefinitely through a closed loop
- Applies different protocols for different materials/conditions
- Maintains a target state rather than producing a product
- Can reset to initial state in case of major deviation
- Prioritizes operational safety over throughput

This is closer to PF-C but with more operational flexibility.

## Final Assessment

| Archetype | Overall Fit | Contrivance Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| PF-E | POOR (0.50) | HIGH |
| PF-C | MODERATE (0.70) | MODERATE |
| Hybrid (CCM) | GOOD (0.85) | LOW |

**Neither pure archetype is a clean fit.** The grammar is most consistent with a
conditioning-like process that has more operational flexibility than pure maintenance
but less throughput focus than pure extraction.

**The mismatch is NOT overwhelming** — both archetypes can be made to fit with
sufficient ad hoc assumptions. This supports the EPM conclusion that internal
analysis cannot distinguish between extraction-type and conditioning-type processes.
