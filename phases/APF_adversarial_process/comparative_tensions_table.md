> **PURPOSE**: Side-by-side comparison of how each archetype fits/struggles

## Summary Comparison

| Metric | PF-E (Extraction) | PF-C (Conditioning) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Structural Coherence | 0.470 | 0.810 |
| Total Tensions | 10 | 2 |
| Unexplained Features | 7 | 6 |
| Strained Assumptions | 2 | 0 |
| Contrivance Level | HIGH | MODERATE |

## Feature-by-Feature Comparison

| Grammar Feature | Fits PF-E | Fits PF-C | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 0 endpoint markers | POOR | GOOD | Extraction expects completion signals |
| 38% mean LINK density | POOR | GOOD | High waiting fits conditioning |
| 100% bidirectional hazards | POOR | GOOD | Extraction is irreversible |
| 18% AGGRESSIVE programs | POOR | POOR | Risky for both archetypes |
| 4.8% ULTRA_CONSERVATIVE | POOR | MODERATE | Unexplained by extraction |
| 16.9% LINK_SPARSE | MODERATE | POOR | Speed priority fits extraction |
| 12% HIGH_INTERVENTION | GOOD | POOR | Monitoring fits extraction |
| 3 restart-capable | POOR | POOR | Too few for extraction, too many for conditioning |
| PHASE_ORDERING 41% hazards | POOR | GOOD | Phase ordering is conditioning concern |
| All programs reach STATE-C | POOR | GOOD | Convergence fits maintenance |
| 83 distinct programs | MODERATE | POOR | Diversity fits extraction variety |
| Extended runs (12.6% gap) | MODERATE | GOOD | Longer maintenance is natural |

## Test-by-Test Coherence Scores

| Test | PF-E Score | PF-C Score | Advantage |
|------|------------|------------|-----------|
| A: Role Distribution | 0.350 | 0.650 | PF-C |
| B: LINK Utilization | 0.700 | 1.000 | PF-C |
| C: Hazard Encoding | 0.400 | 0.800 | PF-C |
| D: Endpoint Absence | 0.050 | 0.900 | PF-C |
| E: Recovery/Restart | 0.850 | 0.700 | PF-E |

## Key Differentiators

### Where PF-E is clearly WORSE:
- Endpoint absence (CRITICAL)
- Bidirectional hazards
- High LINK density
- Conservative program dominance

### Where PF-C is clearly WORSE:
- Program diversity (83 distinct protocols)
- LINK_SPARSE subset
- HIGH_INTERVENTION subset
- Restart capability existence

### Where BOTH struggle:
- AGGRESSIVE programs (neither archetype explains 18% high-risk operation)
- Restart-capable count (3 is awkward for both interpretations)
- Hazard type diversity (5 types is excessive for either archetype)
