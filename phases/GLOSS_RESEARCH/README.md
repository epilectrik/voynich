# GLOSS_RESEARCH Phase

**Status:** OPEN (perpetual)
**Purpose:** Empirical tests to validate, refine, or reject Tier 3-4 gloss assignments.

## Strategy

Assign plausible semantic glosses, then test consistency across the corpus. Revise what doesn't hold. The corpus (23,096 B tokens, 83 folios) is large enough to distinguish real patterns from noise.

## Tests

| # | Script | Question | Status |
|---|--------|----------|--------|
| 01 | suffix_minimal_pairs.py | Do suffixes (-y, -dy, -hy, -ey, -ly) encode different operations when attached to the same stem? | PENDING |

## Current Vocabulary (expert-validated)

### Prefixes
- ch → "check" (active verification, C645 post-hazard)
- sh → "observe" (assessment mode, C408-409)
- qo → "energy" (energy domain, C644)
- ol → "continue" / LINK (C609)
- da → "setup" (infrastructure, C911)
- ok/ot → scaffold (often silent)

### Middles
- e-family → "cool" (STABILITY_ANCHOR C105)
- k-family → "heat/energy"
- ed → "discharge" (kept neutral)
- od → "collect"
- o → "work"

### Suffixes (UNDER TEST)
- -y → terminal (done/step complete)
- -dy → close/seal
- -hy → verify/maintain
- -ey → ??? (e-family terminal — "release"? "ease"? needs evidence)
- -ly → ??? (settled/cooled?)
- -aiin/-ain → check
- -or → portion
- -al → complete
- -am → finalize
- -s → boundary

### Rejected
- ed → "drain" (too liquid-specific, expert rejected)
- or → "measure" (implies parametric quantification, C469)
