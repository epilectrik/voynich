# EXT-1 Limits Statement

**Phase:** EXT-1 (External Procedure Isomorphism)
**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Purpose:** Clear statement of what EXT-1 does and does not establish

---

## What EXT-1 Does Establish

### 1. Structural Compatibility List

EXT-1 identifies **6 procedure classes** whose operational doctrine is structurally isomorphic to the OPS-7 operator doctrine:

| Class | Alignment | Trap Tolerance |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| A. Closed-loop thermal circulation | 5/5 PASS | FULL |
| B. Continuous reflux distillation | 5/5 PASS | FULL |
| C. Volatile aromatic extraction | 5/5 PASS | FULL |
| D. Thermal conditioning/digestion | 5/5 PASS | PARTIAL |
| I. Medical/pharmaceutical distillation | 4/5 PASS | PARTIAL |
| U. Alchemical circulation texts | 4/5 PASS | FULL |

### 2. Elimination Rationale

EXT-1 explicitly eliminates **18 procedure classes** that fail ≥2 doctrine principles, with documented rejection rationale for each.

### 3. Common Structural Signature

Survivors share a structural signature:
- Continuous operation with no encoded endpoints
- Irreversible failure modes
- Expert assumption in documentation
- Patience explicitly valued
- Position markers rather than rescue procedures

### 4. Discriminating Principles

P3 (Restart Requires Low Engagement) and P5 (Throughput Is Transient) are the most discriminating principles. Most craft traditions fail these because they:
- Allow easy restart with new materials
- Value throughput/yield as primary metrics

---

## What EXT-1 Does NOT Establish

### 1. No Product Identification

EXT-1 does NOT identify:
- Specific products
- Specific materials or substances
- What the manuscript was used to produce
- What the operator was making

**Reason:** Product identification is beyond internal structural analysis (see Model Boundary).

### 2. No "Best Match" Declaration

EXT-1 does NOT declare:
- Which survivor is the "correct" interpretation
- A ranked preference among survivors
- A probability distribution over candidates

**Reason:** All survivors are equally compatible with the structural evidence. No internal analysis can distinguish among them.

### 3. No Token Mapping

EXT-1 does NOT:
- Map Voynich tokens to external terminology
- Propose translations or meanings
- Connect human-track tokens to craft vocabulary

**Reason:** Token meanings are beyond recovery (Phase 19, Phase X.5).

### 4. No Historical Identity

EXT-1 does NOT establish:
- Authorship
- Geographic origin
- School or tradition
- Date of composition
- Historical context

**Reason:** Historical identification is beyond internal structural analysis.

### 5. No Illustration Interpretation

EXT-1 does NOT:
- Use illustrations as evidence
- Interpret plant depictions
- Connect visual content to procedure classes

**Reason:** Illustrations are epiphenomenal (Phase ILL).

### 6. No Modification of OPS Conclusions

EXT-1 does NOT:
- Modify the frozen grammar
- Change CEI manifold or regime structure
- Alter hazard topology
- Revise operator doctrine
- Add or remove validated constraints

**Reason:** OPS is CLOSED. EXT-1 is external comparison, not internal revision.

## Relationship to Prior Phases

### EXT-1 Presupposes (READ-ONLY):

| Phase | Constraint | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| OPS-7 | Operator doctrine (5 principles) | LOCKED |
| OPS-6.A | Expert-reference archetype (100% match) | LOCKED |
| OPS-6 | Local smoothing, poor navigation | LOCKED |
| OPS-5 | CEI manifold, LINK damping | LOCKED |
| OPS-4 | Regime switching, prohibited transitions | LOCKED |
| OPS-3 | Risk-time-stability tradeoffs | LOCKED |
| OPS-2 | 4 control regimes | LOCKED |
| OPS-1 | Folio control signatures | LOCKED |

### EXT-1 Does Not Revise:

- 49 instruction classes (frozen)
- 17 forbidden transitions (frozen)
- 83 folios enumerated (frozen)
- 0 translation-eligible zones (frozen)
- 198 validated constraints (frozen)

---

## Scope of Comparison

### What EXT-1 Compares

EXT-1 compares **how experts are expected to behave**, specifically:

- Whether waiting dominates operation
- Whether failures are irreversible
- Whether restart requires calm conditions
- Whether documentation orients rather than rescues
- Whether throughput is discouraged

### What EXT-1 Does Not Compare

EXT-1 does NOT compare:

- Products or outputs
- Materials or inputs
- Specific procedures or steps
- Token vocabulary
- Visual content

---

## Acceptable Outcomes

### Positive Result (What Occurred)

Finding 6 structurally compatible procedure classes is a **positive result** that:
- Confirms the operator doctrine describes a real class of historical practices
- Identifies external traditions sharing the same behavioral structure
- Narrows the comparison space for future external research

### Negative Result (Acceptable Alternative)

Finding ZERO structurally compatible procedure classes would have been **acceptable** and would indicate:
- The operator doctrine describes a unique or unusual practice
- No obvious historical parallels exist
- The comparison space requires expansion or revision

---

## Epistemological Status

### EXT-1 Conclusions Are:

- **Non-binding** — Does not modify internal model
- **Comparative** — Describes similarity, not identity
- **External** — Draws on knowledge outside the manuscript
- **Speculative** — Historical alignment, not proof

### EXT-1 Conclusions Are NOT:

- **Diagnostic** — Cannot identify the "true" purpose
- **Definitive** — Cannot rule out unlisted candidates
- **Binding** — Cannot constrain future analysis

---

## Reaffirmation of OPS Closure

> **OPS is CLOSED. The operator doctrine (5 principles) remains frozen.**
> **EXT-1 does not modify, extend, or challenge OPS conclusions.**
> **All 198 validated constraints remain in force.**

EXT-1 is external comparative analysis. It describes what the manuscript's structure RESEMBLES, not what the manuscript IS.

## Summary

| Question | EXT-1 Answer |
|----------|--------------|
| What procedure classes align structurally? | 6 survivors identified |
| What procedure classes are ruled out? | 18 eliminated with rationale |
| Which survivor is "correct"? | UNDETERMINED (beyond scope) |
| What products were made? | UNDETERMINED (beyond recovery) |
| Does this modify OPS? | NO (OPS is CLOSED) |
| Is this speculative? | YES (external comparison) |

> **EXT-1 compares how experts are expected to behave, not what they are expected to produce.**
