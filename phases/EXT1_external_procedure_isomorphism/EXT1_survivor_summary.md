# EXT-1 Survivor Summary

**Phase:** EXT-1 (External Procedure Isomorphism)
**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Purpose:** Summary of surviving candidate procedure classes and trap-tolerance filter

---

## Survivors (6 Procedure Classes)

### Primary Survivors (5/5 PASS)

Four procedure classes achieved full alignment with all five doctrine principles:

| Class | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|
| A. Closed-loop thermal circulation | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| B. Continuous reflux distillation | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| C. Volatile aromatic extraction | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| D. Thermal conditioning/digestion | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |

### Secondary Survivors (4/5 PASS, 2 PARTIAL)

Two procedure classes survived with partial scores on P4 and/or P5:

| Class | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|
| I. Medical/pharma distillation | PASS | PASS | PASS | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
| U. Alchemical circulation texts | PASS | PASS | PARTIAL | PASS | PASS |

## T4: Trap-Tolerance Filter

The trap-tolerance filter identifies which survivors:
1. **Tolerate trap regions** (situations with no easy exit)
2. **Assume operator commitment** (once started, must see through)
3. **Do NOT provide global recovery navigation** (no rescue procedures)

### A. Closed-loop thermal circulation manuals

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Tolerates traps | **YES** - Circulation can reach stuck states; recovery requires full system reset |
| Assumes commitment | **YES** - Once apparatus charged and heated, operator must continue |
| No global recovery | **YES** - Position markers, not escape routes; expert assumes consequences |

**Verdict:** FULL TRAP TOLERANCE

**Why this survives:** Closed-loop circulation (pelican, circulation vessels) creates thermal and material equilibria that cannot be abandoned mid-process without destroying the batch. Operators must wait through unfavorable states. Documentation provides landmarks for experienced operators, not rescue procedures for novices.

---

### B. Continuous reflux distillation guides

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Tolerates traps | **YES** - Reflux can stall; column flooding traps operator |
| Assumes commitment | **YES** - Once distillation begins, commitment to completion |
| No global recovery | **YES** - Orientation aids, not navigation rescue |

**Verdict:** FULL TRAP TOLERANCE

**Why this survives:** Reflux distillation creates self-perpetuating equilibria. Trapped states (flooding, channeling, stagnation) cannot be escaped without draining and restarting. The operator must wait for the system to self-correct or accept batch loss. Manuals describe what to recognize, not how to escape.

---

### C. Volatile aromatic extraction protocols

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Tolerates traps | **YES** - Extraction can plateau; volatile loss creates irreversible states |
| Assumes commitment | **YES** - Expert judgment assumed for quality assessment |
| No global recovery | **YES** - No rescue procedures for volatile degradation |

**Verdict:** FULL TRAP TOLERANCE

**Why this survives:** Aromatic extraction operates at the edge of volatile degradation. Plateau states (exhausted material, depleted volatiles) cannot be recovered. Operators commit to the run knowing that certain states are terminal. Documentation supports position-awareness, not intervention guidance.

---

### D. Thermal conditioning/digestion procedures

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Tolerates traps | **PARTIAL** - Some conditioning has recovery steps; not all |
| Assumes commitment | **YES** - Extended commitment is definitional |
| No global recovery | **PARTIAL** - Some digestion procedures include rescue options |

**Verdict:** PARTIAL TRAP TOLERANCE

**Why this survives:** Digestion/conditioning procedures vary in their tolerance for intervention. Some (maturation, stabilization) permit no recovery from thermal damage. Others (mild digestion) allow temperature adjustment. This class survives but with noted variability.

---

### I. Medical/pharmaceutical distillation manuals

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Tolerates traps | **PARTIAL** - Quality standards require restart over rescue |
| Assumes commitment | **PARTIAL** - Standardization reduces expert assumption |
| No global recovery | **PARTIAL** - Some rescue procedures exist for purity |

**Verdict:** PARTIAL TRAP TOLERANCE

**Why this survives:** Medical/pharmaceutical distillation prioritizes purity over recovery. Most failures require restart rather than rescue. However, standardization pressures introduced step-by-step procedures and some recovery options. This class survives but shows divergence from pure expert-reference model.

---

### U. Alchemical circulation texts

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Tolerates traps | **YES** - Commitment is philosophical requirement; contamination fatal |
| Assumes commitment | **YES** - Explicitly expert-only; adept assumption |
| No global recovery | **YES** - Contamination requires restart from purification |

**Verdict:** FULL TRAP TOLERANCE

**Why this survives:** Alchemical circulation (philosophical work, prolonged circulation) treats trap states as tests of the operator's patience and understanding. Recovery from contamination requires starting over from purification. Texts provide symbolic landmarks for the initiated, not rescue procedures. The expert-only assumption is explicit.

---

## Trap-Tolerance Summary

| Class | Trap Tolerance | Commitment | No Recovery | Overall |
|-------|----------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| A. Closed-loop thermal circulation | YES | YES | YES | **FULL** |
| B. Continuous reflux distillation | YES | YES | YES | **FULL** |
| C. Volatile aromatic extraction | YES | YES | YES | **FULL** |
| D. Thermal conditioning/digestion | PARTIAL | YES | PARTIAL | **PARTIAL** |
| I. Medical/pharma distillation | PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL | **PARTIAL** |
| U. Alchemical circulation texts | YES | YES | YES | **FULL** |

## Why These Classes Survive

### Common Structural Features

All six survivors share:

1. **Continuous operation** - No defined endpoints within the text; judgment is external
2. **Irreversible failure modes** - Contamination, degradation, thermal damage cannot be undone
3. **Expert assumption** - Documentation assumes operator already knows the process
4. **Patience as virtue** - Waiting is explicitly valued; rushing is explicitly discouraged
5. **Local orientation** - Position markers rather than global navigation

### Distinguishing Features of Full Survivors

The four FULL trap-tolerance classes (A, B, C, U) share additional features:

1. **No rescue procedures** - Documentation provides no way out of bad states
2. **Total commitment** - Once begun, the operator must see through or accept loss
3. **Symbolic landmarks** - Expert recognizes position by experience, not recipe

### Why PARTIAL Survivors Differ

Classes D and I show partial alignment because:

- **D (Conditioning):** Some conditioning allows temperature adjustment; not all is terminal
- **I (Medical):** Standardization introduced procedural elements for reproducibility

---

## Structural Isomorphism Assessment

### Strong Isomorphism (Classes A, B, C, U)

These procedure classes show **structural isomorphism** with the OPS-7 operator doctrine:

| OPS-7 Principle | Isomorphic Feature |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Waiting Is Default | Continuous monitoring; intervention is exception |
| Escalation Irreversible | Thermal/chemical damage cannot be undone |
| Restart Low-Engagement | Must return to baseline; no hot restart |
| Text Holds Position | Expert reference; landmarks not recipes |
| Throughput Transient | Quality valued over speed |

### Moderate Isomorphism (Classes D, I)

These procedure classes show **partial isomorphism** with introduced variations:

| Variation | Significance |
|-----------|--------------|
| Some rescue procedures | Diverges from pure expert-reference model |
| Standardization pressure | Introduces procedural elements |
| Variable trap tolerance | Not all instances share commitment structure |

---

## Borderline Classes (Not Survivors, Not Eliminated)

Two classes failed only one principle and merit discussion:

### E. Metallurgical furnace operation (1 FAIL: P5)

**Why not survived:** Yield optimization explicit; throughput is goal
**Why borderline:** Irreversible failure modes; expert assumption; no easy restart

### F. Fermentation monitoring (1 FAIL: P5)

**Why not survived:** Time-to-completion optimization; throughput valued
**Why borderline:** Waiting dominates; some irreversibility; expert judgment

Both borderline classes fail P5 (Throughput Is Transient) because their historical practice explicitly valued output quantity. This is the critical divergence from the OPS-7 doctrine.

---

## Summary Table

| Category | Count | Classes |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Full Trap Tolerance** | 4 | A, B, C, U |
| **Partial Trap Tolerance** | 2 | D, I |
| **Borderline (1 FAIL)** | 2 | E, F |
| **Eliminated (≥2 FAILs)** | 18 | G-H, J-Z |

---

## What This Shows

EXT-1 identifies **six procedure classes** whose operational doctrine is structurally isomorphic to the OPS-7 operator doctrine:

1. All six share waiting-dominant operation, irreversible escalation, restart constraints, position-not-escape documentation, and transient throughput.

2. Four classes (A, B, C, U) show **full trap tolerance** matching the manuscript's toleration of poor global navigation.

3. Two classes (D, I) show **partial alignment** with introduced variations from standardization or variable procedure types.

4. The common structural signature is: **closed-loop circulatory operation requiring expert judgment, with no defined endpoints, irreversible failure modes, and patience as explicit virtue**.

---

## What This Does NOT Show

- Does not identify which class (if any) is the "correct" match
- Does not identify products, materials, or purposes
- Does not prove historical connection
- Does not modify OPS constraints or conclusions
- Does not prioritize survivors beyond structural alignment

**EXT-1 is comparative, not diagnostic.**
