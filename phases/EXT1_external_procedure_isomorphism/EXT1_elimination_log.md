# EXT-1 Elimination Log

**Phase:** EXT-1 (External Procedure Isomorphism)
**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Purpose:** Explicit rejection rationale for each eliminated procedure class

---

## Elimination Criteria

A procedure class is eliminated if it:
- Fails ≥2 of the 5 doctrine principles (hard elimination)
- Requires encoded endpoints, quantities, or materials (structural incompatibility)
- Is designed for novice training or mass replication (design purpose mismatch)

## Summary

| Elimination Category | Count |
|---------------------|-------|
| ≥3 FAILs | 11 |
| Exactly 2 FAILs | 7 |
| **Total Eliminated** | **18** |

### Common Failure Patterns

| Principle | Failed By | Most Common Issue |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| P3 (Restart) | 16/18 | Easy restart with new materials |
| P5 (Throughput) | 15/18 | Production/yield orientation |
| P4 (Position) | 12/18 | Recipe/procedural documentation |
| P1 (Waiting) | 5/18 | Active intervention required |
| P2 (Escalation) | 2/18 | Recoverable failures |

**Key Finding:** P3 (Restart Requires Low Engagement) and P5 (Throughput Is Transient) are the most discriminating principles. Most craft traditions allow easy restart with new materials and value throughput.
