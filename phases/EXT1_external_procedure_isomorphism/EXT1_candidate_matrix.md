## Doctrine Principles (From OPS-7)

| # | Principle | Structural Requirement |
|---|-----------|------------------------|
| P1 | Waiting Is Default | Deliberate non-intervention dominates operation |

## Scoring Criteria

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **PASS** | Full structural alignment with principle |
| **PARTIAL** | Mixed alignment; some features fit, some don't |
