AXIS 1 REPORT: Currier A Entry Structure as Cognitive Interface
================================================================================

PHASE: Post-Closure Characterization
TIER: 3 (Exploratory characterization)
REBINDING SENSITIVITY: Mostly INVARIANT (1 test FOLIO_LOCAL_ORDER)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q1: Closure vs Incompatibility Pressure
    Order Sensitivity: INVARIANT
    Verdict: NO
    Interpretation: Closure is independent of incompatibility pressure

Q2: Closure vs Novelty (Rare MIDDLEs)
    Order Sensitivity: INVARIANT
    Verdict: WEAK_YES
    Interpretation: Marginal association with rare MIDDLEs

Q3: Closure vs Adjacency Boundaries
    Order Sensitivity: FOLIO_LOCAL_ORDER
    Verdict: NO
    Interpretation: Closure does not mark adjacency boundaries

Q4: Closure vs Discrimination Fragility
    Order Sensitivity: INVARIANT
    Verdict: NO
    Interpretation: Closure is independent of discrimination fragility

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT THIS DOES NOT CHANGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- LINE_ATOMIC (C233) remains unchanged
- Entry grammar (opener/content/closure) is confirmed, not new
- No new grammatical rules proposed
- No semantic interpretation of closure
- C384 (no A-B entry coupling) remains binding
- Closure mechanism is structural, not meaningful

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPLICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NULL FINDINGS:
- Closure appears independent of measured complexity metrics
- This suggests closure is a UNIFORM structural feature
- Not dynamically adjusted to discrimination pressure

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NON-IMPLICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Does NOT imply closure has semantic content
- Does NOT create new entry types or classifications
- Does NOT depend on folio ordering (mostly invariant)
- Does NOT reopen Tier 0-2 constraints
