## Notable Patterns

1. **Peak flowering concentration**: 93% in May-August
2. **Single month peak**: July (33%)
3. **Only outliers**: Violet (April), Juniper (October)
4. **No winter plants**: 0%

This distribution is consistent with documenting **peak-season aromatic plants** used in distillation, not a year-round harvest calendar.

## Limitations

1. Identifications are speculative, not proven
2. Medieval plant depictions are often stylized
3. Same morphological features can match multiple species
4. Regional variation not accounted for
5. Artistic convention may override botanical accuracy
