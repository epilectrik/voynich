## Constraints on Product Speculation

Any candidate product must be compatible with the locked grammar:

| Constraint | Requirement | Effect on Products |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Closed-loop circulation | Recirculation required | Products made through repeated passage |
| Continuous operation | No endpoints encoded | Products judged externally, not by system |
| No phase change | CLASS_C fails | No crystallization, evaporation-to-dryness, solidification |
| Phase-stable substrates | CLASS_A, B, D, E work | Dried plant material, stable liquids |
| Stability priority | 77% conservative programs | Products require patience, not speed |
| No product encoding | 0 identifier tokens | Product specification external to book |
| Expert operation | No definitions | Operator already knows what they're making |

## Candidate Product Class 1: Aromatic Waters

**Description**: Fragrant waters produced by circulating plant material in water/alcohol through a closed-loop apparatus.

### STRUCTURAL SUPPORT

| Grammar Feature | Product Fit | Assessment |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| Closed-loop circulation | Required for aromatic water production | STRONG |
| LINK-heavy programs | Allow volatile equilibration | STRONG |
| No phase change | Aromatics stay dissolved, no distillation-to-dryness | STRONG |
| Stability priority | Gentle extraction preserves volatiles | STRONG |
| No endpoint | Operator judges fragrance externally | STRONG |
| CLASS_A/B materials | Dried aromatic plant matter | STRONG |

### HISTORICAL ALIGNMENT

| Evidence | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Aromatic waters = major 15th-century product | STRONG |
| Brunschwig (1500) details aromatic water production | STRONG |
| Pelican alembic used for aromatic waters | STRONG |
| Rose water, lavender water, etc. highly valued | STRONG |

### PURE SPECULATION

Specific aromatics that might be produced:
- Rose water (rosa)
- Lavender water (lavandula)
- Orange flower water (neroli)
- Rosemary water
- Various medicinal aromatic waters

### Confidence: **MEDIUM-HIGH**

This is the single most structurally aligned product class.

## Candidate Product Class 2: Medicinal Infusions/Extracts

**Description**: Therapeutic preparations made by circulating dried medicinal plants in a carrier fluid.

### STRUCTURAL SUPPORT

| Grammar Feature | Product Fit | Assessment |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| Closed-loop circulation | Gradual extraction | STRONG |
| Diverse program library | Different plants need different handling | STRONG |
| AGGRESSIVE programs | Some plants need pushing | MODERATE |
| CONSERVATIVE programs | Delicate plants need care | MODERATE |
| No endpoint | Potency judged by taste/color/experience | STRONG |
| CLASS_A materials | Dried medicinal herbs | STRONG |

### HISTORICAL ALIGNMENT

| Evidence | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Medicinal preparations = core medieval pharmacy | STRONG |
| Antidotaria (recipe books) common in period | STRONG |
| Extraction apparatus documented | MODERATE |
| Expert-operated medical preparation | STRONG |

### PURE SPECULATION

Types of preparations:
- Simple herbal extracts
- Compound medicinal waters
- Tinctures (alcohol-based)
- Digestive preparations

### What Remains Unexplained

- No ingredient lists in grammar (expected for recipes)
- No dosage information (expected for medicines)
- 83 programs seems excessive for general medicine

### Confidence: **MEDIUM**

Plausible but less specifically aligned than aromatic waters.

---

## Candidate Product Class 3: Concentrated Essences

**Description**: Intensified plant extracts made by extended circulation and gradual concentration.

### STRUCTURAL SUPPORT

| Grammar Feature | Product Fit | Assessment |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| Extended programs (43 folios) | Long processing time | STRONG |
| AGGRESSIVE programs | Intensification requires pushing | MODERATE |
| No phase change | Concentration without evaporation | PROBLEMATIC |
| Stability priority | Prevents degradation during long process | STRONG |

### HISTORICAL ALIGNMENT

| Evidence | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Quintessences sought by alchemists | MODERATE |
| Concentration valued in pharmacy | MODERATE |
| Pelican used for "circulation" (concentration) | MODERATE |

### Problem: Concentration Usually Requires Phase Change

To concentrate, you typically need to remove solvent (evaporation). The grammar explicitly fails on phase-unstable materials.

**Possible Resolution**: The system produces "as-concentrated-as-possible-without-phase-change" extracts, relying on:
- Long circulation time
- Selective extraction
- External finishing steps

### Confidence: **LOW-MEDIUM**

Plausible but tension with no-phase-change constraint.

| 100% convergence | All programs reach stable state | STRONG |
| STATE-C as target | Stability as goal | STRONG |
| LINK-heavy operation | Equilibration-focused | STRONG |

### HISTORICAL ALIGNMENT

| Evidence | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Stabilization valued for trade | MODERATE |
| Preserved preparations for transport | MODERATE |
| "Circulated" products in alchemical literature | MODERATE |

### PURE SPECULATION

The system might:
- Stabilize volatile preparations
- Condition extracts for storage
- "Mature" products to improve keeping quality

### What Remains Unexplained

- Why 83 different programs for stabilization?
- Why AGGRESSIVE programs exist if goal is stability?

### Confidence: **LOW-MEDIUM**

Possible for ULTRA_CONSERVATIVE programs; doesn't explain full library.

---

## The 83-Program Problem

Any product interpretation must explain why 83 distinct programs exist.

### Possible Explanations (PURE SPECULATION)

| Explanation | Plausibility | Issue |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **83 different products** | LOW | No product identifiers |
| **83 substrate variations** | MEDIUM | Fits material diversity |
| **Learning progression** | MEDIUM | Fits risk gradient finding |
| **Regional/trade variants** | LOW | Speculative |
| **Redundancy/alternatives** | LOW | Why include all? |

**Most Plausible**: The 83 programs represent **different substrate × intensity combinations**, not 83 different end products.

**Workshop Interpretation** (PURE SPECULATION):

> *"There's maybe 5-10 things we actually make, but dozens of ways to get there depending on what material we have and what condition it's in. Different sources, different batches, different seasons—each needs slightly different handling."*

---

## Synthesis: What This Book Might Be For

**PURE SPECULATION** (LOW confidence for specifics, MEDIUM for class):

The Voynich Manuscript might be:

> **An operator's reference for a small aromatic-water or medicinal-extract workshop**, providing programs for different material types and processing intensities, allowing an expert operator to select the right approach for their specific substrate and conditions.

The book does NOT specify:
- What to make (operator knows)
- What materials to use (operator knows)
- When to stop (operator judges)
- What the outcome should be (operator judges)

The book DOES provide:
- 83 pre-approved operating programs
- Safety-aware progression (easy → hard)
- Recovery protocols for errors
- Material-class-appropriate handling

---

## The Operator's Perspective (PURE SPECULATION)

An early 15th-century practitioner using this book might:

1. **Know their trade** — Trained in the workshop, knows products and materials
2. **Consult the book** — Find the right program for today's substrate
3. **Run the apparatus** — Follow the program's control sequence
4. **Judge the result** — Taste, smell, color, experience tells them when done
5. **Adjust next time** — Try a different program if this one wasn't right

The book is a **tool for the expert**, not a teacher for the novice.

## What This Does NOT Claim

- ❌ Specific products identified
- ❌ Specific materials identified
- ❌ Commercial vs. personal use determined
- ❌ Geographic origin determined
- ❌ Historical identity determined

## Stop Condition: Practitioner's Summary

> **If I were an early-15th-century practitioner using this book, here are three concrete things I might plausibly be trying to make:**

### 1. AROMATIC WATERS (MEDIUM-HIGH confidence)

Rose water, lavender water, or other fragrant plant-derived waters made by circulating dried aromatic plant material through a closed-loop reflux apparatus. The book tells me which program to use for which type of material, and I judge when the fragrance is right.

### 2. MEDICINAL HERBAL EXTRACTS (MEDIUM confidence)

Simple or compound preparations made by circulating dried medicinal herbs in water or alcohol. Different programs for different herbs—some gentle (for delicate flowers), some aggressive (for tough roots). I know what I'm making; the book tells me how to run the apparatus safely.

### 3. STABILIZED/MATURED PREPARATIONS (LOW-MEDIUM confidence)

Taking a previously-made extract and "finishing" it through extended gentle circulation, allowing components to equilibrate and the preparation to stabilize for storage or use. The ULTRA_CONSERVATIVE and LINK_HEAVY programs would serve this purpose.

---

> **And three things I almost certainly would NOT be trying to make:**

### 1. DISTILLED SPIRITS (RULED OUT)

The grammar cannot handle phase changes. Making brandy or aqua vitae requires vapor-to-liquid transition. This apparatus and these programs are not for that.

### 2. CRYSTALLIZED PRODUCTS (RULED OUT)

Sugar crystals, salt crystals, mineral precipitates—all require liquid-to-solid phase change. The grammar fails catastrophically (PHASE_COLLAPSE) on such processes.

### 3. SEPARATED/PURIFIED FRACTIONS (RULED OUT)

If I wanted to split a mixture into distinct fractions (like chromatography), I'd need open flow. The grammar requires closed-loop circulation. Separation isn't what this does.
