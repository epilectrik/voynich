## Vector C: Gradient Steepness

**Recipes analyzed:** 183

### Hypothesis Results

| Hypothesis | Test | Result | Status |
|------------|------|--------|--------|
| H-C1: Transition velocity differs by | ANOVA | F=1.56, p=0.1999 | FAIL |
| H-C2: Commitment sharpness correlate | point-biserial correlation | r=nan, p=1.0000 | FAIL |
| H-C3: Setup duration: GENTLE > other | t-test | t=-1.10, p=0.2730 | FAIL |
| H-C4: Gradient steepness correlates  | Pearson correlation | r=-0.069, p=0.3568 | FAIL |

**Passed:** 0/4
**Verdict:** INCONCLUSIVE

## Vector A: Interface Theory

**Judgments analyzed:** 13

### Zone Judgment Availability

| Zone | Required | Permitted | Impossible |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|
| C | 1 | 9 | 3 |
| P | 9 | 1 | 3 |
| R | 6 | 7 | 0 |
| S | 5 | 0 | 8 |

### Hypothesis Results

| Hypothesis | Result | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|
| H-A1: Judgment availability >70% non-uniform | 84.6% non-uniform | PASS |
| H-A2: At least 3 judgments with significant zo | 11 significant | PASS |
| H-A3: HT density correlates with judgment coun | r=-0.425 | FAIL |

**Passed:** 2/3
**Verdict:** TIER_3_ENRICHMENT

## Final Pressure Test: Judgment Elimination Trajectories

**The decisive finding:** The manuscript is a JUDGMENT-GATING SYSTEM.

### Agency Withdrawal Curve

| Zone | Available | Required | Impossible | Freedom |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|---------|
| C | 10 | 1 | 3 | 77% |
| P | 10 | 9 | 3 | 77% |
| R | 13 | 6 | 0 | 100% |
| S | 5 | 5 | 8 | 38% |

### Key Findings

- **Freedom collapse:** 77% -> 38% (38% withdrawn)
- **FORBIDDEN INTERVENTION onset:** Zone 0
- **WATCH CLOSELY eliminated at S:** 4/6

### Interpretation

> The manuscript progressively removes human judgment freedoms phase by phase

**Mechanism:** Agency withdrawal curve: C(77%) -> P(77%) -> R(100%) -> S(38%)

**Key insight:** S-zone eliminates 8/13 judgments - the outcome is locked, human intervention is no longer possible

---

## Overall Interpretation

### Semantic Boundary Resolution Achieved

This phase achieved **semantic boundary resolution** - precisely locating the semantic ceiling and understanding WHY it exists.

Key discoveries:
- The semantic ceiling was NOT breached by naming things
- It was breached by discovering that meaning lives in the **withdrawal of agency**
- The artifact tells you *when judgment is no longer yours*

### The Reframe

> **The Voynich Manuscript is a machine for removing human freedom at exactly the moments where freedom would be dangerous.**

This is not a failure to decode tokens. This IS going further - into **meta-semantics of control and responsibility**.

## Constraint Compliance

| Constraint | How Respected |
|------------|---------------|
| C384 | Labels trajectories and phases, not tokens |
| C434 | Uses R-series ordering as foundation |
| C443 | Extends escape gradients with temporal dimension |
| C469 | Judgment availability is categorical |
