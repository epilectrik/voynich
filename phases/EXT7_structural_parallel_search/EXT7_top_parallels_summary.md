## Top Parallel #1: John of Rupescissa — Quintessence Texts (c. 1351-52)

**Score:** 7.0/10
**Tier:** 3 (Plausible Partial Parallel)

### Structural Resemblance

The quintessence extraction texts of John of Rupescissa share the **highest structural alignment** with the Voynich's operational grammar:

| Feature | Rupescissa | Voynich | Match |
|---------|------------|---------|-------|
| Circulation logic | ✅ Seven-fold distillation + circulation in glass | ✅ 100% bidirectional hazards | **STRONG** |
| Prolonged waiting | ✅ "Circulation" requires weeks of patient operation | ✅ 38% LINK density | **STRONG** |
| Operator-centric | ✅ Temperature regulation central | ✅ Vessel survival > output | **STRONG** |
| High restart penalty | ✅ Contamination destroys batch | ✅ Irreversible failures | **STRONG** |
| Indefinite operation | ✅ Perfection approached asymptotically | ✅ 0 endpoint markers | **STRONG** |
| Text-independent | ✅ Procedural, not illustrated | ✅ Grammar from text alone | **STRONG** |

### Decisive Divergences

| Feature | Rupescissa | Voynich | Divergence |
|---------|------------|---------|------------|
| Materials | ✅ Wine explicitly specified | ❌ No materials encoded | **MAJOR** |
| Product | ✅ Single product (quintessence) | ❌ 83 programs (library) | **MAJOR** |
| Theoretical framework | ✅ Extensive theory of quintessence | ❌ 0 theoretical content | **MAJOR** |
| Didactic elements | ⚠️ Explains rationale for procedures | ❌ No explanations | MODERATE |

### Significance

Rupescissa's quintessence tradition represents the **closest known structural analog** to the Voynich's operational logic. The circulation/cohobation model, indefinite perfection-seeking, and operator-centric hazard awareness all match strongly.

However, Rupescissa's texts **specify the starting material (wine)** and **explain the theoretical rationale** for circulation. The Voynich does neither. This suggests the Voynich may be structurally descended from or parallel to the quintessence tradition, but pushed further toward pure operational abstraction.

## Top Parallel #2: Pseudo-Geber — Summa Perfectionis (c. 1300)

**Score:** 6.5/10
**Tier:** 3 (Plausible Partial Parallel)

### Structural Resemblance

The Summa Perfectionis shares several structural features with the Voynich:

| Feature | Pseudo-Geber | Voynich | Match |
|---------|--------------|---------|-------|
| Expert-facing | ✅ Assumes prior alchemical training | ✅ Non-didactic | **STRONG** |
| Circulation logic | ✅ Describes sublimation, distillation cycles | ✅ Closed-loop operation | **STRONG** |
| Operator-centric | ✅ Furnace operation hazards central | ✅ Vessel survival > output | **STRONG** |
| High restart penalty | ✅ Failed operations not recoverable | ✅ Irreversible failures | **STRONG** |
| Text-independent | ✅ Procedural descriptions, minimal illustrations | ✅ Grammar from text alone | **STRONG** |

### Decisive Divergences

| Feature | Pseudo-Geber | Voynich | Divergence |
|---------|--------------|---------|------------|
| Theoretical content | ✅ Extensive theory of sulfur-mercury | ❌ 0 theoretical content | **MAJOR** |
| Named materials | ✅ Philosophical Mercury, sulfur, etc. | ❌ No materials encoded | **MAJOR** |
| Quantitative specs | ⚠️ Some proportions given | ❌ No quantities | MODERATE |
| Waiting phases | ⚠️ Implied but not central | ✅ 38% LINK density | MODERATE |
| Library structure | ⚠️ Corpus of procedures | ✅ 83 distinct programs | MODERATE |

### Significance

The Summa Perfectionis represents the **canonical medieval alchemical manual** — widely circulated, highly influential, and structurally sophisticated. Its expert-facing, circulation-based, hazard-aware structure shows significant overlap with the Voynich.

However, the Summa is **explicitly theoretical** (sulfur-mercury theory), **names materials** (even if allegorically), and **includes quantitative specifications**. The Voynich strips all of these away. This suggests the Voynich may be operating at a **higher level of abstraction** than the Summa — encoding operation without material or theoretical context.

## Top Parallel #3: Brunschwig — Liber de arte distillandi (1500)

**Score:** 5.0/10
**Tier:** 3-4 (Borderline Parallel)

### Structural Resemblance

Brunschwig's distillation manual shows moderate structural overlap:

| Feature | Brunschwig | Voynich | Match |
|---------|------------|---------|-------|
| Library structure | ✅ Multiple procedures for different plants | ✅ 83 programs | **STRONG** |
| Waiting phases | ⚠️ Some distillation requires patience | ✅ 38% LINK density | MODERATE |
| Apparatus focus | ⚠️ Describes furnaces, vessels | ⚠️ Apparatus-facing | MODERATE |
| Expert-facing | ⚠️ Assumes distillation knowledge | ✅ Non-didactic | MODERATE |

### Decisive Divergences

| Feature | Brunschwig | Voynich | Divergence |
|---------|------------|---------|------------|
| Named materials | ✅ Plants explicitly specified | ❌ No materials encoded | **MAJOR** |
| Illustrations | ✅ Integral to text (plant identification) | ❌ Illustrations epiphenomenal | **MAJOR** |
| Endpoint-defined | ✅ Produce medicinal water | ❌ No endpoints encoded | **MAJOR** |
| Simple distillation | ✅ One-pass distillation dominant | ❌ Circulation/cohobation | **MAJOR** |

### Significance

Brunschwig represents the **closest printed parallel** to the Voynich in the distillation manual tradition. However, it is fundamentally a **product-oriented manual** — it specifies what plants to use, how to distill them, and what ailments the products treat.

The Voynich does none of this. The divergence in illustration-dependence is particularly decisive: Brunschwig's plant illustrations are **integral to the text** (you need them to identify what to distill), while the Voynich's illustrations are **epiphenomenal** (the grammar works without them).

## What the Top Parallels Reveal

### Common Signature of Partial Matches

All three top parallels share:
- Circulation or cohobation logic
- Expert-facing operation
- Hazard awareness
- Apparatus-centric procedure

But all three also include content the Voynich lacks:
- Named materials (even if allegorical)
- Theoretical rationale (even if minimal)
- Endpoint specification (even if vague)

### The Voynich's Distinctive Features

The Voynich exceeds all known parallels in:
1. **Material abstraction** — 0 materials named
2. **Theoretical abstraction** — 0 theoretical content
3. **Endpoint abstraction** — 0 completion signals
4. **Library scale** — 83 distinct programs (not 1-10)
5. **Illustration independence** — Grammar works without images

### Structural Position

The Voynich appears to occupy a **unique structural position**:
- More operationally pure than the quintessence tradition
- More library-scale than the alchemical treatises
- More apparatus-abstract than the distillation manuals
- More material-agnostic than any known craft notebook

## Relationship to Surviving Document Classes

### What the Voynich IS Structurally Similar To:

| Class | Similarity | Key Overlap |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Quintessence texts (Rupescissa) | HIGH | Circulation, waiting, indefinite operation |
| Latin alchemical treatises (Pseudo-Geber) | MODERATE-HIGH | Expert-facing, hazard-aware, apparatus-centric |
| Distillation manuals (Brunschwig) | MODERATE | Library structure, apparatus focus |

### What the Voynich IS NOT Structurally Similar To:

| Class | Similarity | Key Mismatch |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Recipe books (Antidotarium) | LOW | Explicit quantities, endpoints |
| Cookbooks | LOW | Endpoint-defined, no circulation |
| Mining treatises (Bergbüchlein) | VERY LOW | Didactic, not operational |
| Encyclopedias (Secretum) | VERY LOW | Advisory, not operational |
| Illuminated alchemy (Splendor Solis) | LOW | Illustration-dependent |
