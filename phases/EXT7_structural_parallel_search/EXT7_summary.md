# EXT-7 Summary

## Narrative Summary

EXT-7 tested whether any surviving historical technical manuscripts (1400-1550) structurally resemble the Voynich Manuscript's executable control grammar. The answer is **partial parallels exist, but the Voynich is structurally exceptional**.

Sixteen candidate manuscripts were evaluated against a 10-point structural fingerprint derived from OPS and EXT constraints. Two manuscript traditions showed significant overlap: the **quintessence tradition** (John of Rupescissa, 7.0/10) and **Latin alchemical treatises** (Pseudo-Geber, 6.5/10). Both share the Voynich's core features: circulation/cohobation logic, prolonged waiting phases, high restart penalty, and operator-centric hazard awareness.

However, no known manuscript matches the Voynich's level of abstraction. The Voynich uniquely combines:
- 0 materials named (vs. wine, sulfur-mercury, plants in comparands)
- 0 theoretical content (vs. quintessence theory, transmutation theory)
- 0 endpoint markers (vs. "produce quintessence," "produce water")
- 83 distinct programs (vs. 1-10 procedures in typical manuals)
- Illustration independence (vs. plant images integral to distillation manuals)

The null comparison class (recipe books, cookbooks, encyclopedias) fails on 5/10 features, confirming the Voynich is structurally distinct from these document types.

## Key Findings

| Finding | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Partial structural parallels exist | CONFIRMED (Tier 2) |
| Quintessence tradition = closest match | CONFIRMED (7.0/10) |
| Voynich exceeds all comparands on abstraction | CONFIRMED (Tier 2) |
| Recipe/cookbook class fails structurally | CONFIRMED (Tier 2) |
| Voynich is structurally exceptional | CONFIRMED |

## Verdict

> **"Partial parallels exist, but Voynich is structurally exceptional."**

## Top Parallels (Scored)

| Rank | Manuscript | Score | Tier |
|------|------------|-------|------|
| 1 | John of Rupescissa (Quintessence) | 7.0/10 | Tier 3 |
| 2 | Pseudo-Geber Summa Perfectionis | 6.5/10 | Tier 3 |
| 3 | Brunschwig Liber de arte distillandi | 5.0/10 | Tier 3-4 |

---

## Structural Position

> The Voynich Manuscript occupies the **extreme endpoint** of a continuum from symbolic alchemy (Pseudo-Geber) through operational alchemy (Rupescissa) to pure operational abstraction (Voynich).

## What EXT-7 Does NOT Establish

- Specific textual lineage
- Translation or copying relationship
- Author identity
- Illustration interpretation
- Why the abstraction level is so extreme

EXT-7 establishes **structural comparison** only, not derivation.
