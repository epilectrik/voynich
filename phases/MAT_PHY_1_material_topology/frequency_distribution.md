# Test E: Frequency Distribution Shape

**Question:** Do material usage frequencies follow the same shape as Currier A token frequencies?

**Verdict:** STRONG MATCH - Botanical material frequencies follow heavy-tailed (Zipf-like) distribution.

---

## Expected Pattern (from Currier A)

MIDDLE type frequencies in Currier A exhibit:
- **Heavy-tailed:** Few high-frequency types, many rare types
- **Rare preserved:** Low-frequency MIDDLEs NOT collapsed
- **Power-law shape:** Frequency ∝ 1/rank

**Test question:** Do real botanical material usage frequencies show the same distribution shape?

## Evidence Source 1: European Materia Medica (2,500 Years)

### Study Design

A PMC study analyzed 12 historical medical texts spanning from 5th century BC to 1865 AD, compiling **985 total simples** (medicinal substances).

### Frequency Distribution

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| All 12 sources (highest frequency) | 14 | 1.4% |
| 11+ sources | 26 | 2.6% |
| 8+ sources | 159 | 16.2% |
| 6+ sources | 267 | 27.1% |
| 4+ sources | 439 | 44.6% |
| **1-3 sources (rare)** | **546** | **55.4%** |

**Key finding:** The distribution is HEAVILY SKEWED:
- Top 1.4% appear in ALL sources
- Bottom 55.4% appear in only 1-3 sources

This is the SAME shape as Zipf's law.

### Rare Materials Preserved

The study notes:
> "A large number of simples were used sporadically or in limited regions."

These rare materials were NOT collapsed into common categories - they were **preserved despite low frequency**. This matches the anti-mnemonic property of Currier A.

## Evidence Source 2: Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescriptions

### Study Design

A ScienceDirect study analyzed **84,418 TCM prescriptions** for herb frequency distribution.

### Key Finding

> "The distribution of TCM herbs in TCM prescriptions conformed to Zipf's law."

The study performed linear fitting and confirmed the herb frequency distribution follows a power-law pattern.

### Implication

Zipf's law in herb usage means:
- A few herbs dominate (like lavender, ginseng)
- Many herbs are rare but preserved
- The distribution shape matches natural language

## Evidence Source 3: Essential Oil Market Data

### Market Distribution

| Oil Category | Market Share |
|--------------|--------------|
| Orange oil | Largest share (11 kilotons) |
| Corn mint | Second largest |
| Eucalyptus | Third largest |
| Lemon | 7 kilotons |
| **All others combined** | Long tail |

**Top 3-5 oils dominate volume; hundreds of rare oils exist.**

### Popular vs. Rare

Common oils (lavender, peppermint, tea tree) appear in nearly every product line.

Rare oils (agarwood, Bulgarian rose, blue lotus) are:
> "Derived from rare, endangered, or geographically restricted plant species that can only thrive in specific, unique microclimates."

**Key insight:** Rare materials are NOT eliminated from the market - they are preserved at premium prices. This matches the preservation of rare MIDDLEs.

## Distribution Shape Comparison

### European Materia Medica vs. Currier A

| Rank | Materia Medica Pattern | Currier A Pattern |
|------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Top 2% | High frequency (all sources) | High frequency (hub MIDDLEs) |
| Middle 40% | Moderate frequency | Moderate frequency |
| Bottom 55% | Rare but preserved | Rare but preserved |
| Shape | Power-law (Zipf-like) | Power-law (Zipf-like) |

**Result: MATCH**

---

## Why This Distribution Emerges

### Not Arbitrary - Physics-Forced

1. **Common materials are common for a reason:** They grow widely, extract easily, work broadly

2. **Rare materials are rare for a reason:** Geographic restriction, difficult extraction, narrow application

3. **Preservation reflects value:** Rare materials serve specific functions that common materials cannot

### Comparison to Alternative Distributions

| Distribution | Shape | Match? |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| Uniform | Flat | ❌ |
| Normal | Bell curve | ❌ |
| Exponential | Steep decay | ⚠️ Partial |
| **Power-law (Zipf)** | Heavy tail | ✅ |

Both botanical materials AND Currier A MIDDLEs follow power-law distribution.

## Rare Material Preservation

### Key Test: Are Rare Materials Collapsed?

From materia medica study:
- 546 simples appeared in only 1-3 sources over 2,500 years
- These were NOT collapsed into common categories
- They were preserved as distinct entries

From essential oil market:
- Hundreds of rare oils exist at premium prices
- These are NOT replaced by common alternatives
- Specialty markets preserve rare distinctions

**This matches C476:** Currier A preserves rare MIDDLEs despite efficiency cost.

---

## Test E Result: PASS

| Criterion | Threshold | Result |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Heavy-tailed distribution | Power-law shape | ✅ Confirmed (Zipf) |
| Rare materials preserved | Not collapsed | ✅ 55% rare in materia medica |
| Common materials dominate volume | Top few dominate | ✅ Top 1.4% in all sources |
| Match to Currier A shape | Same qualitative type | ✅ Power-law match |

Botanical material usage frequencies follow the SAME heavy-tailed distribution as Currier A token frequencies.
