# Test D: Hub Rationing Evidence

**Question:** Do practitioners avoid over-relying on "universal" materials even when they are technically safe?

**Verdict:** STRONG MATCH - Multiple domains show deliberate rationing of universal/safe options.

---

## What "Hub Rationing" Means

From SSD-PHY-1a and C476, Currier A exhibits:
- Hub MIDDLEs are UNDERUSED relative to coverage optimization
- Authors prefer specific MIDDLEs over universal ones
- This is ANTI-MNEMONIC (harder than necessary)

**Test question:** Does real botanical practice show the same pattern?

## Evidence Category 1: The 3-5 Oil Rule

### Practitioners Limit Blends Even When More Would Be "Safe"

From aromatherapy guidance (Edens Garden):
> "Synergies are most effective when essential oils are selected for a singular purpose."

> "Combining too many essential oils can take away from a blend's effectiveness."

> "The benefits of an essential oil blend become muddled when combining two blends."

**Recommendation:** 3-5 oils maximum per blend.

**Key insight:** More oils are technically SAFE but practitioners deliberately AVOID using them because effectiveness is lost. This is hub rationing - constraining use of available options.

---

## Evidence Category 2: Brunschwig's Reinfusion Limit

### Distillation Author Limits "Safe" Operations

From Brunschwig's *Liber de arte distillandi* (1500):
> "A water which is about to become corrupt can 'prevail against its time' if it is reinfused with fresh herbs and then distilled, but this may happen **no more than twice**."

**Key insight:** Reinfusion with aqua vitae (the ultimate "hub" solvent) is TECHNICALLY possible more than twice, but Brunschwig FORBIDS it. This is explicit hub rationing - limiting use of the universal solvent.

## Evidence Category 3: Simples vs. Compound Formulas

### Herbalists Deliberately Choose Specificity

From herbal medicine tradition (Red Moon Herbs):
> "Using one herb at a time gives unparalleled opportunities to observe and make use of the subtle differences at the heart of herbal medicine."

> "By using simples, interactions between herbs and medications are easier to observe and avoid."

The Eclectic medical tradition (19th century North America):
> "The Eclectics, while prolific and holistic in their approach, tended to favor simples (single herbs), though they did use basic formulas as well."

**Key insight:** Practitioners COULD use multi-herb formulas (compound solutions), but many PREFER single herbs (simples) because it preserves fine distinctions. This is the same pattern as preserving rare MIDDLEs rather than collapsing to hubs.

---

## Evidence Category 4: Niche Perfumery Philosophy

### Artisans Reject Universal/Generic Ingredients

From industry analysis (Smell Stories):
> "Niche perfumes are better—more creative, higher quality, made with rare ingredients... designer perfumes are often portrayed as generic, made to please the masses."

> "The first niche brands emerged as a reaction against 'mass production.' They wanted to return to the essence of perfume: artisanal, original creations made with noble ingredients."

**Key insight:** Artisan perfumers AVOID "universal" ingredients that would make formulation easier. They seek SPECIFICITY over EASE. This is exactly the anti-mnemonic pattern of C476.

---

## Evidence Category 5: Avoid "Muddling" Effects

### Too Much Universality Destroys Information

From essential oil blending (AroMed Essentials):
> "If you add too many oils, the different notes can mix and mingle too much and lead to an undesirable outcome."

From perfumery reviews:
> "I found it overwhelming... overly sweet and heavy."

**Key insight:** Over-use of universal elements (fixatives, bases) DESTROYS the distinctions the system is trying to track. Rationing hubs PRESERVES information.

## Comparison to Currier A

| Pattern | Botanical Practice | Currier A (MIDDLE) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Limit universal materials | 3-5 oil rule, "no more than twice" | Hub MIDDLEs underused |
| Prefer specifics | Simples tradition, niche perfumery | Rare MIDDLEs preserved |
| Reason | Preserve distinctions | Anti-mnemonic structure |
| Cost | Harder than necessary | Harder than necessary |

**Result: MATCH**

---

## Why This Pattern Exists

Hub rationing is NOT arbitrary convention. It serves functional purposes:

1. **Information preservation:** Over-using hubs collapses distinctions
2. **Observability:** Simples allow tracking specific effects
3. **Quality:** Specificity produces better outcomes
4. **Expertise demonstration:** Knowing WHICH specific material works shows mastery

**The same reasons apply to A's MIDDLE structure:** If hubs were overused, the registry would lose its ability to track fine distinctions.

---

## Counter-Hypothesis: Is This Just Quality Preference?

**Objection:** Maybe practitioners just prefer "quality" ingredients?

**Response:** The pattern goes beyond quality:
- Brunschwig's reinfusion limit applies to the BEST solvent (quintessence)
- The 3-5 oil rule applies even with high-quality oils
- Simpling applies even with excellent compound formulas available

The rationing is STRUCTURAL, not quality-based.

## Test D Result: PASS

| Criterion | Threshold | Result |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Practitioners limit universal materials | Evidence found | ✅ Multiple domains |
| Prefer specific over generic | Evidence found | ✅ Simples, niche perfumery |
| Anti-mnemonic pattern | Structure preserved | ✅ Information > ease |
| Match to hub rationing | Same pattern | ✅ C476 alignment |

Real botanical practitioners DELIBERATELY avoid over-reliance on universal materials, matching Currier A's hub rationing pattern.
