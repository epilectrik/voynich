# MAT-PHY-1: Material Constraint Topology Alignment — Phase Specification

**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Tier:** 3 (Exploratory, Non-Binding)
**Prerequisites:** PWRE-1 ✅, FM-PHY-1 ✅, SSD-PHY-1a ✅, OJLM-1 ✅, APP-1 ✅

---

## Core Principle (MANDATORY)

> **This phase compares topologies, not meanings.**
> No token → plant mapping is allowed or attempted.

We are NOT asking: "What plant is MIDDLE 'a'?"
We ARE asking: "Does A's constraint graph look like what chemistry forces?"

---

## Purpose

Test whether Currier A's incompatibility and coverage topology matches the **structural constraint topology forced by real pre-instrumental botanical chemistry**, without decoding identity.

This is the **A-system analogue of FM-PHY-1** - comparing topologies, not meanings.

---

## Critical Constraints (From Expert Review)

### ❌ WRONG: "Hub MIDDLEs = universal solvents (water, alcohol)"
### ✅ RIGHT: "Hub MIDDLEs = compatibility-neutral infrastructure elements"

The test asks:
> **"Do real systems require a small set of compatibility-neutral elements to bridge otherwise incompatible regimes?"**

NOT "which 5 substances match the hubs."

---

### ❌ WRONG: "Do botanical materials show ~95% pairwise incompatibility?"
### ✅ RIGHT: Reframe as operational incompatibility under processing constraints

The correct question:
> **"Under constraints of co-processing in a single circulatory reflux run with shared control parameters and no instrumentation, are the majority of material pairs operationally incompatible?"**

Incompatibility means:
- Same vessel
- Same heat regime
- Same timing window
- No intermediate cleaning
- No parametric tuning

## Pre-Registered Tests

### Test A: Operational Incompatibility Density
**Question:** What fraction of material pairs are incompatible under single-run co-processing constraints?
**Threshold:** >80%

### Test B: Compatibility-Neutral Infrastructure Elements
**Question:** Do a small number of elements bridge otherwise incompatible communities?
**Threshold:** 3-7 bridges account for >50% of community connections

### Test C: Sparse + Clustered + Bridged Topology
**Question:** Does the real material constraint graph have the same topology class as MIDDLE?
**Threshold:** Same qualitative type (sparse constraint satisfaction graph with hub bridges)

### Test D: Hub Rationing Evidence
**Question:** Do practitioners avoid over-relying on "universal" materials?
**Threshold:** Documentary evidence found

### Test E: Frequency Distribution Shape
**Question:** Do material usage frequencies follow the same distribution shape as A tokens?
**Threshold:** Similar power-law exponent and tail behavior

---

## Success Criteria

| Result | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| **STRONG MATCH** | All 5 tests pass |
| **PARTIAL MATCH** | 3-4 tests pass |
| **MISMATCH** | <3 tests pass |

## What This Phase Can Conclude

### ✅ CAN Conclude (if tests pass):
- Currier A encodes a REAL chemical constraint topology
- Incompatibility structure is chemistry-forced, not cryptographic
- Dimensionality is justified by material science limits
- The registry structure matches botanical processing constraints

### ❌ CANNOT Conclude (regardless of results):
- Which MIDDLE = which specific plant
- Which PREFIX = petals/leaves/roots
- Any identity-level decoding
- Semantic content of any token

## Epistemic Safety Clause

> *This phase compares topologies, not meanings. It tests whether Currier A's constraint structure matches what pre-instrumental botanical chemistry forces - without claiming which token corresponds to which material. No identity-level decoding is attempted or claimed. All findings are Tier 3 unless they establish logical necessity.*
