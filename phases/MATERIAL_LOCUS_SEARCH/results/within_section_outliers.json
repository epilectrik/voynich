Divergent MIDDLEs classified by Levenshtein distance to nearest common MIDDLE (top-100 by frequency): distance<=1 = operational variant (per C939), distance=2 = moderate, distance>2 = independent. Candidate material discriminators require: independent status AND folio count >= 2 (or global count >= 5 if folio count = 1).",

All 38 independent MIDDLEs (distance>2 from any common MIDDLE) are hapax legomena (global count=1, folio count=1), meaning they are noise in the compositional tail, not recurring material identifiers. The 420 operational variants (91.7%) dominate divergence. Folio vocabulary differences within sections reflect different operational configurations (kernel profiles, regime emphasis, procedural phase selection) rather than different material identities. This is consistent with C939 (zone-exclusive MIDDLEs are compositional variants), C619 (unique MIDDLEs are behaviorally interchangeable), and the semantic ceiling (C120).",
