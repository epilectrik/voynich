# SSD-PHY-1a FIT Entries

## Summary

SSD-PHY-1a produced **negative proofs** and **structural characterizations**, not semantic fits.

No new FIT entries are warranted because:
1. Lower-bound proof establishes what is IMPOSSIBLE, not what IS
2. Topology classification describes geometry, not content
3. Hub necessity proves structural inevitability, not identity
4. Cognitive/physical separation establishes source, not meaning

## Candidate Findings (NOT promoted)

The following could be considered for future promotion if independent validation supports them:

### F-SSD-001 (CANDIDATE, NOT PROMOTED)
**Statement:** The MIDDLE discrimination space requires D ≥ 50 categorical dimensions.
**Status:** Tier 3 — requires quantitative validation
**Reason for non-promotion:** Based on semi-formal argument, not rigorous proof

### F-SSD-002 (CANDIDATE, NOT PROMOTED)
**Statement:** Hub MIDDLEs are structurally inevitable under sparse + clustered + navigable constraints.
**Status:** Tier 3 — structural argument, not empirical test
**Reason for non-promotion:** No direct falsifiable test performed

### F-SSD-003 (CANDIDATE, NOT PROMOTED)
**Statement:** The discrimination space complexity is plant-imposed, not notation-driven.
**Status:** Tier 3 — based on anti-mnemonic property assessment
**Reason for non-promotion:** Requires independent cognitive science validation

## Recommendation

No immediate promotions. These findings strengthen the architectural understanding but do not add new semantic content to the FIT table.

If expert review validates the dimensional lower-bound argument, F-SSD-001 could be considered for Tier-2 promotion as a structural constraint.
