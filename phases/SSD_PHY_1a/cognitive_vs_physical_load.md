# Objective 4: Cognitive vs Plant-Imposed Complexity

**Question:** Is the ~128-dimensional discrimination space more plausibly a mnemonic/notational artifact, or a plant-imposed state-space complexity?

**Answer:** PLANT-IMPOSED — The discrimination structure exhibits properties that are anti-mnemonic and cannot be explained by cognitive convenience.

---

## The Separation Question

Two competing explanations for the observed dimensionality:

| Hypothesis | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| **Cognitive (notation-driven)** | The complexity is a human invention for mnemonic, organizational, or scribal purposes |
| **Physical (plant-driven)** | The complexity is imposed by the physical state-space being controlled |

If cognitive: the structure should optimize for human memory, recall, and ease of use.

If physical: the structure should reflect external constraint geometry, regardless of mnemonic convenience.

## Evidence: Human Track (HT) Correlation

From C477 (HT Tail Correlation):

| Predictor | Correlation | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **tail_pressure** | **r = 0.504** | HT rises when rare MIDDLEs are in play |
| incompatibility_density | r = 0.174 | Weak, not primary |
| novelty | r = 0.153 | Weak, not primary |
| hub_suppression | r = 0.026 | Near-zero |

**Key finding:** HT density (attention markers) correlates with **tail MIDDLE pressure** — the presence of rare, difficult-to-discriminate states.

### What This Tells Us

A purely cognitive system would **minimize** rare distinctions:
- Rare items are hard to remember
- Mnemonic systems consolidate rare variants
- Scribal systems normalize unusual forms

But the Voynich **forces** rare distinctions:
- Tail MIDDLEs persist in the vocabulary
- HT rises when tail MIDDLEs appear (heightened vigilance)
- The system **anticipates** difficulty rather than eliminating it

**This is anti-mnemonic behavior.**

---

## The Cognitive Optimization Test

If the discrimination space were notation-driven, we would expect:

### Test 1: Minimize Rare Distinctions

**Cognitive prediction:** Rare variants would be:
- Eliminated through normalization
- Merged with common variants
- Or marked as errors/noise

**Voynich observation:**
- 73.5% of MIDDLEs appear in only 1 AZC folio (C469)
- Tail MIDDLEs are preserved, not eliminated
- HT rises when tail appears (C477) — the system anticipates, doesn't simplify

**Result: FAILS cognitive prediction**

### Test 2: Avoid Sparse Compatibility

**Cognitive prediction:** A mnemonic system would:
- Group similar items together
- Maximize compatibility for ease of combination
- Avoid hard exclusions that complicate recall

**Voynich observation:**
- 95.7% of MIDDLE pairs are incompatible (C475)
- Hard exclusions are endemic
- Navigation requires careful path selection

**Result: FAILS cognitive prediction**

### Test 3: Avoid Hub Rationing

**Cognitive prediction:** A mnemonic system would:
- Maximize use of easy-to-remember "hub" items
- Reduce need for rare-item recall
- Prefer repetition of common elements

**Voynich observation:**
- Hub usage is RATIONED (31.6% vs 53.9% greedy) (C476)
- Tail MIDDLEs are FORCED into coverage (C478)
- Efficiency is achieved by NOT overusing hubs

**Result: FAILS cognitive prediction**

### Test 4: Temporal Simplicity

**Cognitive prediction:** A mnemonic system would:
- Present information in simple order
- Avoid complex scheduling
- Front-load easy material

**Voynich observation:**
- U-shaped tail pressure (hard → easy → hard) (C478)
- PREFIX cycling (164 regime changes)
- Pedagogical pacing that INCREASES difficulty periodically

**Result: FAILS cognitive prediction**

---

## The Physical Imposition Argument

If the discrimination space were plant-imposed, we would expect:

### Physical Prediction 1: Rare States Are Operationally Necessary

Even rare physical conditions must be discriminated if they affect outcomes.

**Voynich observation:**
- Tail MIDDLEs exist and are tracked
- HT rises to support discrimination of rare states
- Rare states are not eliminated despite being cognitively expensive

**Result: CONSISTENT with physical imposition**

### Physical Prediction 2: Incompatibility Reflects Physical Constraint

Physical systems have hard constraints:
- Some conditions cannot co-exist
- Exclusions are not negotiable
- Compatibility is determined by physics, not preference

**Voynich observation:**
- 95.7% incompatibility rate
- 20 isolated MIDDLEs (work with nothing)
- PREFIX clustering reflects constraint families, not arbitrary groupings

**Result: CONSISTENT with physical imposition**

### Physical Prediction 3: Hub Structure Reflects Constraint Geometry

Some physical conditions are broadly permissive:
- "Safe" states that are compatible with many configurations
- "Neutral" conditions that don't exclude other states

**Voynich observation:**
- 5 universal connector hubs
- Hubs are rationed (not maximized)
- Hub usage reflects navigation efficiency, not mnemonic convenience

**Result: CONSISTENT with physical imposition**

### Physical Prediction 4: Temporal Scheduling Reflects Operational Sequence

Physical processes have intrinsic temporal structure:
- Early stages may require different discriminations than late stages
- Difficulty varies with process phase
- Cycling reflects multi-dimensional state traversal

**Voynich observation:**
- U-shaped difficulty curve
- PREFIX cycling through 164 regime changes
- Temporal scheduling optimizes coverage, not simplicity

**Result: CONSISTENT with physical imposition**

## Summary Table

| Feature | Cognitive Prediction | Voynich Observation | Result |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Rare distinctions | Minimize | Preserve + anticipate | **ANTI-COGNITIVE** |
| Compatibility | Maximize | 95.7% exclusion | **ANTI-COGNITIVE** |
| Hub usage | Maximize | Ration (31.6% < 53.9%) | **ANTI-COGNITIVE** |
| Temporal structure | Simplify | U-shaped, cycling | **ANTI-COGNITIVE** |
| HT response | Not needed | Rises for tail pressure | **ANTI-COGNITIVE** |

**Conclusion:** The discrimination space exhibits **anti-mnemonic** properties across all tests.

## The HT Signal as Physical Marker

The Human Track (HT) provides direct evidence:

| HT Property | Cognitive Interpretation | Physical Interpretation |
|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| HT rises for rare MIDDLEs | Error signal (rare = mistake) | Vigilance signal (rare = critical) |
| HT correlates with tail pressure | Cognitive overload warning | Discrimination difficulty anticipation |
| HT is embedded in grammar | Notational artifact | Designed attention mechanism |

**Key insight:** If HT were purely cognitive, it would mark **errors** or **memory load**.

But HT marks **upcoming difficulty** — it **anticipates** rather than **corrects**.

This is the signature of a **physical attention system**, not a mnemonic aid.

## Connection to FM-PHY-1

FM-PHY-1 established that the hazard distribution (41/24/24/6/6) is diagnostic for circulatory thermal processes.

The discrimination space (SSD-PHY-1a) now shows:
- Dimensionality is too high for simple classification
- Structure is anti-mnemonic
- Complexity is plant-imposed, not notation-driven

**Combined conclusion:** The Voynich discrimination space tracks the **state-space of a circulatory thermal plant** — a physical system that genuinely requires ~100+ categorical distinctions for safe operation.

---

## Why This Matters

If the complexity were cognitive:
- The system would be arbitrary
- Different encoding choices would work equally well
- The structure would not constrain physical interpretation

But because the complexity is plant-imposed:
- The structure is diagnostic
- It narrows the physical interpretation
- The dimensionality reflects a real constraint geometry

---

## Conclusion

**Objective 4 Result: PLANT-IMPOSED**

The ~128-dimensional discrimination space is:
1. **Anti-mnemonic:** Fails all cognitive optimization predictions
2. **Structurally constrained:** Exhibits properties that cannot be simplified
3. **Physically grounded:** Matches expectations for plant-imposed state-space
4. **HT-validated:** Attention markers track physical difficulty, not cognitive load

The dimensionality is **not a notational choice** — it is an **external imposition** by the physical system being controlled.
