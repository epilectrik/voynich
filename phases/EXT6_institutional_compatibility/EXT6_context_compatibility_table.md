# EXT-6 Context Compatibility Table

**Phase:** EXT-6 (Institutional, Regional, and Workshop Compatibility Audit)
**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Purpose:** Test whether any historically plausible context (ca. 1400-1550) satisfies ALL established constraints simultaneously

---

## Compatibility Criteria (From Locked Constraints)

Each context must plausibly support:

1. **C1: Extended Sealed Hazardous Circulation** — Weeks-months sealed pelican-class operation
2. **C2: Toxic Mineral Handling** — Mercury, antimony, gold work without modern regulation
3. **C3: Expert Visual Ambiguity** — Manuals with non-instructional illustrations acceptable
4. **C4: Lack of Instructional Scaffolding** — Expert assumes prior training, no didactic content
5. **C5: Manuscript Survival** — Document survives without censorship or destruction

## Region 1: Central Europe (German-Speaking Lands, Basel-Prague Axis)

### 1.1 Goldsmith/Assayer Workshops

| Timeframe | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Verdict | Conflicts |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 1400-1470 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ COMPATIBLE | None |
| 1470-1520 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ COMPATIBLE | None |
| 1520-1550 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ COMPATIBLE | Minor: Reformation disruptions |

**Evidence:**
- Mercury amalgamation standard goldsmith technique (documented)
- Antimony used for gold purification "by the hundredweight" (Britannica)
- 5-9 year apprenticeships = expert assumes training
- Guild secrecy protected techniques from outsiders
- Nuremberg and Augsburg major metalworking centers
- No regulatory prohibition on sealed circulation
- Manuscripts concealed within guild networks

**Assessment:** STRONG FIT (Tier 3). All criteria satisfied. Guild secrecy and expert training models align with non-didactic documentation.

### 1.2 Court-Sponsored Private Laboratories

| Timeframe | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Verdict | Conflicts |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 1400-1470 | ⚠ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Sparse documentation of court labs this early |
| 1470-1520 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Rising but not yet dominant |
| 1520-1550 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ COMPATIBLE | None |

**Evidence:**
- Rudolf II's laboratories extensively documented (but 1580s-1612)
- Earlier court patronage less systematic
- Prague Castle underground laboratories existed
- Imperial protection shields from prosecution
- Private nature supports non-disclosure

**Assessment:** COMPATIBLE for 1520-1550; MARGINAL for earlier periods. Court alchemy documented mainly post-manuscript.

---

### 1.3 Apothecary-Adjacent Laboratories

| Timeframe | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Verdict | Conflicts |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 1400-1470 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Less documentation; apothecaries less regulated than Italy |
| 1470-1520 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Same |
| 1520-1550 | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Paracelsian context emerging |

**Evidence:**
- Paracelsus invited "apothecaries" to Basel lectures (1527)
- German apothecary traditions less codified than Italian
- Some production of complex preparations documented
- But: pharmacy tradition emphasizes recipes and endpoints

**Assessment:** MARGINAL. Apothecary tradition implies recipe-based practice, creating tension with no-endpoint grammar.

---

### 1.4 University-Adjacent Non-Curricular Practice

| Timeframe | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Verdict | Conflicts |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 1400-1470 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ INCOMPATIBLE | University teaching = didactic content |
| 1470-1520 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ INCOMPATIBLE | Same |
| 1520-1550 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ INCOMPATIBLE | Same |

**Evidence:**
- Medieval universities: curricular structure requires explanatory texts
- Alchemy taught as natural philosophy (Aristotelian framework)
- Students need instructional scaffolding
- University context incompatible with non-didactic manual

**Assessment:** INCOMPATIBLE. University teaching tradition contradicts C4 (lack of instructional scaffolding).

---

## Region 2: Northern Italy (Venice, Florence)

### 2.1 Goldsmith/Assayer Workshops

| Timeframe | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Verdict | Conflicts |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 1400-1470 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ COMPATIBLE | None |
| 1470-1520 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | 1488 Venice chrysopoeia ban (limited scope) |
| 1520-1550 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Increasing regulatory attention |

**Evidence:**
- Strong goldsmith tradition in Northern Italy
- Venice 1488 ban on gold-making (chrysopoeia) — BUT specific to transmutation fraud
- Mercury/antimony refining NOT banned (assay work continues)
- Guild protections present
- Apprenticeship system in place

**Assessment:** COMPATIBLE for 1400-1470; MARGINAL for later periods due to increasing oversight. The 1488 ban targets chrysopoeia specifically, not all metalwork.

---

### 2.2 Court-Sponsored Private Laboratories

| Timeframe | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Verdict | Conflicts |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 1400-1470 | ⚠ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Medici interest begins but less operative |
| 1470-1520 | ⚠ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Caterina Sforza documented as alchemist |
| 1520-1550 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Francesco I's laboratory later (1570s) |

**Evidence:**
- Cosimo de' Medici brought Neoplatonic/alchemical texts to Florence (15th c)
- Caterina Sforza (1463-1509) documented alchemist
- Francesco I's Studiolo/laboratory explicitly alchemical (1570s)
- Florence did NOT issue ban like Venice
- But: Catholic context creates some tension

**Assessment:** MARGINAL across all periods. Court laboratories documented but not systematically in target timeframe.

---

### 2.3 Apothecary-Adjacent Laboratories

| Timeframe | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Verdict | Conflicts |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 1400-1470 | ⚠ | ✓ | ❌ | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ INCOMPATIBLE | Public oversight of Theriac production |
| 1470-1520 | ⚠ | ✓ | ❌ | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ INCOMPATIBLE | Same |
| 1520-1550 | ⚠ | ✓ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠ | ❌ INCOMPATIBLE | Same + 1515 printing censorship |

**Evidence:**
- Venice Theriac production: public, state-supervised, in bronze cauldrons on street
- Guild oversight required quality control and inspection
- Apothecary exams required Latin literacy and recipe knowledge
- Saladino d'Ascoli's ideal apothecary: "well-educated and skilled"
- Strong tension with non-didactic, visually ambiguous documentation

**Assessment:** INCOMPATIBLE. Venetian apothecary guild model emphasizes public accountability, recipe transmission, and quality inspection — direct conflict with C3 and C4.

---

### 2.4 University-Adjacent Non-Curricular Practice

| Timeframe | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Verdict | Conflicts |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 1400-1470 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ INCOMPATIBLE | University teaching = didactic |
| 1470-1520 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ INCOMPATIBLE | Same |
| 1520-1550 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ❌ | ⚠ | ❌ INCOMPATIBLE | Same + Leo X 1515 censorship |

**Evidence:**
- Italian universities: Padua, Bologna famous for medicine
- Curricular alchemy = theoretical (Aristotelian)
- Teaching tradition incompatible with non-didactic format
- 1515 papal censorship bull adds oversight

**Assessment:** INCOMPATIBLE. Same C4 conflict as Central Europe.

## Region 3: Iberian Peninsula

### 3.1 Goldsmith/Assayer Workshops

| Timeframe | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Verdict | Conflicts |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 1400-1470 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Less documentation of alchemical goldsmith work |
| 1470-1520 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Same |
| 1520-1550 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Inquisition attention rising but not on alchemy per se |

**Evidence:**
- Mercury: Almadén (Spain) major cinnabar source
- Goldsmith guilds existed but less documented for alchemical practice
- Inquisition not focused on alchemy (per Britannica: "rarely intervened in matters of magic")
- But: Less evidence of sustained operative laboratory practice

**Assessment:** MARGINAL. Insufficient positive evidence; not eliminated but not strongly supported.

---

### 3.2 Court-Sponsored Private Laboratories

| Timeframe | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Verdict | Conflicts |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 1400-1470 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Portuguese navigation focus; less alchemical documentation |
| 1470-1520 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Same |
| 1520-1550 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Same |

**Evidence:**
- Prince Henry "Navigator" sponsored scientific work but focused on navigation
- Arabic alchemical tradition influential but less operative documentation for this period
- Philip II later collected banned texts (preserved at Escorial)
- Insufficient evidence for sustained court laboratory practice

**Assessment:** MARGINAL. Underdetermined — insufficient evidence to confirm or eliminate.

---

### 3.3 Apothecary-Adjacent Laboratories

| Timeframe | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Verdict | Conflicts |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 1400-1470 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Valencia pharmaceutical traditions documented |
| 1470-1520 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Same |
| 1520-1550 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Chemical medicine emerging but criticized |

**Evidence:**
- Valencia "chemical medicine" documented late 16th century
- Physician Coçar called "alchemist" as criticism
- Less documentation for sealed hazardous circulation
- Underdetermined for target timeframe

**Assessment:** MARGINAL. Insufficient evidence.

### 3.4 University-Adjacent Non-Curricular Practice

| Timeframe | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Verdict | Conflicts |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 1400-1470 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ INCOMPATIBLE | University = didactic |
| 1470-1520 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ INCOMPATIBLE | Same |
| 1520-1550 | ⚠ | ✓ | ⚠ | ❌ | ⚠ | ❌ INCOMPATIBLE | Same |

**Evidence:**
- Salamanca and other universities: curricular tradition
- Same C4 conflict as other regions

**Assessment:** INCOMPATIBLE. University context universally fails C4.
