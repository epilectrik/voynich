# EXT-6 Summary

**Phase:** EXT-6 (Institutional, Regional, and Workshop Compatibility Audit)
**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Status:** COMPLETE

## Narrative Summary

EXT-6 tested whether any historically plausible institutional, regional, and temporal context (ca. 1400-1550) could simultaneously satisfy all established constraints. The answer is **yes**: goldsmith/assayer workshops in Central Europe (1400-1550) and Northern Italy (1400-1470) survive all constraint tests. Court-sponsored laboratories in Central Europe (1520-1550) also survive, though with weaker documentation.

The surviving contexts share a common structural signature: guild-protected expert practice, normalized toxic mineral handling, non-curricular knowledge transmission, and economic rationale for extended hazardous runs. This signature aligns precisely with the EXT-5B ecosystem of guild-restricted, court-sponsored, expert-operated alchemical-medical practice.

Two institutional contexts were eliminated: **university-adjacent practice** (all regions) fails because university teaching requires didactic scaffolding, and **Northern Italian apothecary-adjacent practice** fails because Venetian guild oversight requires public accountability and recipe-based documentation. The Iberian Peninsula remains underdetermined—no conflicts identified, but insufficient positive evidence.

## Key Findings

| Finding | Status |
|---------|--------|
| At least one context survives all constraints | CONFIRMED (Tier 3-4) |
| Goldsmith/assayer workshops strongest fit | CONFIRMED |
| University-adjacent eliminated | CONFIRMED (C4 violation) |
| N. Italy apothecary-adjacent eliminated | CONFIRMED (C3, C4 violation) |
| Iberia underdetermined | CONFIRMED (insufficient evidence) |

## Verdict

> ✅ **"One or more contexts survive all constraints (Tier 3-4)."**

## Eliminated Contexts

| Context | Constraint Violated |
|---------|---------------------|
| University-Adjacent (all regions) | C4: Instructional scaffolding required |
| N. Italy Apothecary-Adjacent | C3: Public oversight; C4: Recipe focus |

## What This Does NOT Establish

- Specific author identity
- Specific city or workshop
- Specific guild affiliation
- Exact date of production
- Specific product being made
- Illustration meanings

EXT-6 establishes **structural compatibility** only, not provenance.
