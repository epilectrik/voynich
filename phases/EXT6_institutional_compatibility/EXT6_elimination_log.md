# EXT-6 Elimination Log

**Phase:** EXT-6 (Institutional, Regional, and Workshop Compatibility Audit)
**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Purpose:** Document contexts eliminated and the constraints they violate

---

## Eliminated Contexts

### 1. University-Adjacent Non-Curricular Practice (ALL REGIONS, ALL TIMEFRAMES)

| Region | Timeframe | Verdict | Primary Conflict |
|--------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Central Europe | 1400-1550 | ❌ ELIMINATED | C4: Instructional scaffolding |
| Northern Italy | 1400-1550 | ❌ ELIMINATED | C4: Instructional scaffolding |
| Iberian Peninsula | 1400-1550 | ❌ ELIMINATED | C4: Instructional scaffolding |

**Why Eliminated:**

The medieval and Renaissance university model is structurally incompatible with the manuscript's non-didactic format.

**Evidence of Conflict:**
- University teaching requires explanatory content (C4 violation)
- Curricular alchemy = theoretical Aristotelian framework (not operative)
- Students need definitions, progression, context
- University texts are inherently pedagogical

**Constraint Violated:** C4 — Lack of instructional scaffolding

**Severity:** ABSOLUTE. No university-adjacent context can satisfy C4. This elimination is permanent.

### 2. Northern Italy Apothecary-Adjacent Laboratories (ALL TIMEFRAMES)

| Region | Timeframe | Verdict | Primary Conflict |
|--------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Northern Italy | 1400-1470 | ❌ ELIMINATED | C3 + C4: Public oversight, recipe focus |
| Northern Italy | 1470-1520 | ❌ ELIMINATED | C3 + C4: Same |
| Northern Italy | 1520-1550 | ❌ ELIMINATED | C3 + C4: Same + censorship |

**Why Eliminated:**

The Venetian apothecary guild model emphasizes public accountability, recipe transmission, and quality inspection — direct conflicts with the manuscript's operational structure.

**Evidence of Conflict:**
- Venice Theriac production: PUBLIC, state-supervised, in bronze cauldrons ON STREET
- Guild oversight required quality control and INSPECTION
- Apothecary exams required Latin literacy and RECIPE KNOWLEDGE
- Saladino d'Ascoli's ideal apothecary: "well-educated and skilled" — implies didactic training
- 1565 College of Apothecaries formalized quality standards

**Constraint Violated:**
- C3 — Expert visual ambiguity: Public supervision requires clear documentation
- C4 — Lack of instructional scaffolding: Recipe tradition implies endpoint specification

**Severity:** ABSOLUTE for Venice/Florence apothecary guild contexts. These models are incompatible with non-didactic, visually ambiguous process documentation.

## Marginal Contexts (Not Eliminated, Insufficiently Supported)

### 3. Iberian Peninsula (All Institutions Except University)

| Institution | Timeframe | Verdict | Issue |
|-------------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Goldsmith/Assayer | All | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Insufficient positive documentation |
| Court-Sponsored | All | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Navigation focus; alchemy underdocumented |
| Apothecary-Adjacent | All | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Insufficient evidence |

**Why Marginal (Not Eliminated):**

No direct conflicts identified, but insufficient positive evidence for sustained alchemical laboratory practice in the target timeframe.

**What Would Confirm:**
- Documentation of sealed hazardous circulation workshops
- Evidence of guild-protected mineral preparation
- Manuscript traditions compatible with non-didactic format

**What Would Eliminate:**
- Evidence that Inquisition prosecuted all alchemy (not just necromancy/fraud)
- Guild regulations requiring endpoint specification
- Script traditions incompatible with Voynich

**Current Status:** UNDERDETERMINED. Cannot confirm or eliminate with available evidence.

### 4. Central Europe Apothecary-Adjacent (All Timeframes)

| Timeframe | Verdict | Issue |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| 1400-1550 | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Recipe tradition creates tension |

**Why Marginal:**

German apothecary traditions less codified than Italian, but pharmacy inherently implies recipe-based practice with defined endpoints.

**Tension:** Apothecary work produces PRODUCTS (waters, syrups, tinctures). The manuscript encodes PROCESS with no endpoints. This is a structural mismatch, though not an absolute elimination.

**Note:** Paracelsus (1527) invited apothecaries to his lectures, suggesting some overlap between alchemical and pharmaceutical practice. This creates a narrow window of compatibility in late period (1520-1550).

---

### 5. Northern Italy Court-Sponsored (All Timeframes)

| Timeframe | Verdict | Issue |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| 1400-1550 | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Documented but not systematic |

**Why Marginal:**

Court-sponsored laboratories documented in Northern Italy (Medici, Sforza), but:
- Francesco I's Studiolo = 1570s (post-manuscript)
- Caterina Sforza's alchemy documented but not laboratory infrastructure
- Cosimo de' Medici = Neoplatonic/theoretical focus

No absolute conflict, but insufficient positive evidence for sustained sealed circulation operations.

---

### 6. Central Europe Court-Sponsored (1400-1520)

| Timeframe | Verdict | Issue |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| 1400-1470 | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Sparse documentation |
| 1470-1520 | ⚠️ MARGINAL | Rising but not dominant |

**Why Marginal:**

Rudolf II's court laboratories (1580s-1612) extensively documented, but earlier court patronage less systematic. The timeframe is too early for the well-documented Prague phenomenon.

**Note:** 1520-1550 period is classified as COMPATIBLE because court interest in alchemy was rising (pre-Rudolf precursors).

---

## Non-Conflicts (Explicitly Evaluated and Passed)

### A. Pope John XXII's 1317 Bull (*Spondent quas non exhibent*)

**Not a conflict.**

The bull targets FRAUDULENT alchemy (counterfeiting, false transmutation), not all alchemical work. The Pope himself maintained a laboratory at Avignon. Mercury/antimony preparation for assay or conditioning is not prohibited by this decree.

### B. Venice 1488 Chrysopoeia Ban

**Partial conflict, not absolute elimination.**

The ban specifically targets gold transmutation (chrysopoeia). It does NOT prohibit:
- Mercury preparation for other purposes
- Antimony use in gold refining (assay work)
- Sealed circulation for non-transmutation purposes

Goldsmith work in Venice remains MARGINAL (not eliminated) because assay and refining continue under guild oversight.

### C. Roman Inquisition

**Not a conflict for target timeframe.**

Per the research: "In the latter half of the sixteenth century, the Roman Inquisition developed criteria to prosecute operative arts... Its officials had little interest in alchemy." Prosecution of alchemy rare; mostly late 16th century. For 1400-1550, Inquisition attention to alchemy is minimal.

### D. Spanish Inquisition

**Not a conflict.**

Per the research: "The Inquisition rarely intervened in matters of magic." Prosecution for alchemy combined with necromancy or demon-summoning (e.g., Pedro Ruiz Calderón), not for alchemical preparation alone.

### E. Manuscript Script Tradition

**Not a conflict — consistent with concealment.**

The Voynich script is unique and matches no regional tradition. This is COMPATIBLE with intentional concealment, not a disqualifying conflict. Alchemical manuscripts commonly used pseudonyms, allegory, and concealment strategies.
