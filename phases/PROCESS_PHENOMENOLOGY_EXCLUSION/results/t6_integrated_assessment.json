Thread A: 25 sensory phenomena of pelican operation map bidirectionally to architectural features (98.3% coverage), hazard distribution matches pelican failure modes (rho=0.900), and the 6-state automaton maps to physically necessary operational modes (score=0.964). Thread B: All 7 alternative domains score below 37.5% compatibility, with 18/20 features being 'killer' discriminators that exclude all alternatives. This does NOT prove the manuscript is a distillation manual, but it establishes that no other 15th-century process domain produces a compatible structural fingerprint."
