# PROCESS_PHENOMENOLOGY_EXCLUSION

**Tier:** 4 (SPECULATIVE)
**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Purpose:** Sensorimotor reconstruction + domain exclusion stress test

## Tests

| Test | Purpose | Verdict Logic |
|------|---------|---------------|
| T1 | Structural fingerprint compilation | COMPILED / INCOMPLETE |
| T2 | Sensorimotor ontology (25 phenomena, bidirectional coverage) | VIABLE / PARTIAL / NOT_VIABLE |
| T3 | Hazard class phenomenology (distribution alignment) | COHERENT / PARTIAL / INCOHERENT |
| T4 | Alternative domain compatibility (7 domains × 20 features) | EXCLUDED / WEAKLY_EXCLUDED / NOT_EXCLUDED |
| T5 | Six-state thermodynamic necessity | DERIVED / CONSISTENT / INCONSISTENT |
| T6 | Integrated assessment | DISTILLATION_SUPPORTED / PARTIAL / INCONCLUSIVE / REJECTED |
