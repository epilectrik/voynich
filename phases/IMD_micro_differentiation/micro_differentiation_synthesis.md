# Phase IMD: Intra-Role Micro-Differentiation — Synthesis

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Mode:** DISCIPLINED SPECULATION

> **SPECULATIVE** — Outcome-based micro-differentiation. Does not modify frozen model.

## Overall Summary

| Role | Tokens | Verdict | Significant Tests | Strong Effects |
|------|--------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| CF-6 | 1 | INSUFFICIENT_DATA | 0 | 0 |
| CF-3 | 910 | WEAK_SIGNAL | 3 | 0 |
| CF-1 | 124 | STRONG_SIGNAL | 3 | 2 |
| CF-2 | 126 | STRONG_SIGNAL | 3 | 1 |

## Key Findings

### Strong Signal: CF-1, CF-2

These roles show significant outcome divergence between surface tokens.
Surface variants encode **expectation or warning memory** — operators
differentiated 'the dangerous kind' from 'the routine kind' of the same state.

### Weak Signal: CF-3

These roles show detectable but limited outcome variation.
Surface tokens encode **finer situational nuance** but not strong warnings.

## Craft Interpretation

The manuscript preserves **craft memory** at the micro level:

- Not all APPROACHING tokens are equal — some mark higher-risk moments
- Not all RELAXING tokens are equal — some mark premature relaxation
- Surface variation correlates with **what usually happens next**

This is exactly where experienced perfumers keep meaning:
- 'that smell again'
- 'this is the bad run'
- 'this kind of waiting usually works out'

## Warning Memory Candidates

**Elevated Hazard Tokens:** `otos, lkeeo, cheocthy, chocthey, qolshedy, cheoky, ykar, chok, chot, dom, ytchol, chopchy, checkhey, ykeechy, cheeor`

**Elevated Escalation Tokens:** `odaiin, otos, lkeeo, air, arar, cheocthy, chocthey, qolshedy, cheoky, ykar, chok, chot, dom, ytchol, chopchy`

These tokens show outcome profiles consistent with 'this usually goes wrong' markers.

## What This Does NOT Claim

- We have NOT decoded any tokens
- We have NOT assigned meanings to surface forms
- We have NOT proven craft identity
- We have NOT modified the frozen grammar model

We have shown that surface variation **correlates with outcome expectations**
in a way consistent with expert craft memory.
