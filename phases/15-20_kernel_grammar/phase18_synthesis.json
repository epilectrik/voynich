  "FORMAL_HAZARD_STATEMENT": "The Voynich control system explicitly prevents 5 classes of irrecoverable error, dominated by PHASE_ORDERING failures. The mutual exclusions dominant - most failures are incompatible state pairs directional pattern (asymmetry ratio 0.00) indicates state incompatibility awareness. Failures cluster in kernel_adjacent pattern, suggesting dangerous edge conditions around control points. This hazard model is consistent with expert-level operators managing reflux distillation where Vapor lock, premature condensation are the primary concerns.",

  "INTERPRETATION": "FAILURE-MODE TYPOLOGY INTERPRETATION\n\nThe Voynich control system encodes 5 classes of irrecoverable error:\n\n  ENERGY_OVERSHOOT: 1 transitions\n    Physical cause: Bumping, scorching, thermal shock\n\n  PHASE_ORDERING: 7 transitions\n    Physical cause: Vapor lock, premature condensation\n\n  RATE_MISMATCH: 1 transitions\n    Physical cause: Flooding, weeping, channeling\n\n  COMPOSITION_JUMP: 4 transitions\n    Physical cause: Contamination, impurity carryover\n\n  CONTAINMENT_TIMING: 4 transitions\n    Physical cause: Overflow, pressure failure\n\nDominant failure mode: PHASE_ORDERING\n  (PHASE_ORDERING represents the primary safety concern)\n\nDirectional pattern: MUTUAL_EXCLUSIONS_DOMINANT - Most failures are incompatible state pairs\n  (Asymmetry ratio: 0.00)\n\nSpatial pattern: KERNEL_ADJACENT\n  (Failures cluster at kernel boundaries - dangerous edge conditions around control points)\n\nPhysical coherence: HIGH\n\nThe forbidden transitions represent empirically-discovered 'don't do this' rules,\nencoding practical knowledge of what leads to process failure in distillation.\nThis hazard model is consistent with a teaching system designed to\nprotect expert-level operators.",
  "IMPLICATIONS": [
    "Forbidden transitions encode real operational hazards, not arbitrary rules",
    "The system was designed by someone with practical distillation experience",
    "Failure prevention is physics-based, matching known distillation problems",
    "The hazard model serves as a teaching/warning system for operators",
    "System targets expert-level practitioners"
