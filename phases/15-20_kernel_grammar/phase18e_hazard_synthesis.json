  "FORMAL_HAZARD_STATEMENT": "The Voynich control system explicitly prevents 5 classes of irrecoverable error, dominated by PHASE_ORDERING failures. The mutual exclusions dominant - most failures are incompatible state pairs directional pattern (asymmetry ratio 0.00) indicates state incompatibility awareness. Failures cluster in kernel_adjacent pattern, suggesting dangerous edge conditions around control points. This hazard model is consistent with expert-level operators managing reflux distillation where Vapor lock, premature condensation are the primary concerns."
