# Phase: STRUCTURAL_TOPOLOGY_TESTS

## Pre-Registration

**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Tier:** 3-4 (Exploratory)
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Purpose

Exploit insights from HISTORICAL_STRUCTURAL_MATCHING_II to generate internal structural tests against Tier 0-2 constraints. Historical parallels serve as hypothesis generators, not explanations.

## Key Principle (Expert-Validated)

> Treat medieval historical systems not as explanations, but as hypothesis generators for additional *structural tests* against frozen Tier 0-2 constraints.

## Background

HISTORICAL_STRUCTURAL_MATCHING_II confirmed:
- Tria prima maps to 3 of 4 M-classes (M-C gap identified)
- Memory art parallels (ars memoria) validated
- Decision-point grammar confirmed (heads/hearts/tails)
- Strategy encoding confirmed (degrees of fire)

## Tests (Priority Order)

### Test 1: M-C Gap Investigation (TOP PRIORITY)
**Question:** Why does the system need a category that is STABLE and DISTINCT (M-C)?
**Rationale:** Tria prima maps to M-A, M-B, M-D but NOT M-C. Expert: "Single strongest new idea."

### Test 2: Forbidden Strategy Boundaries (STRONG)
**Question:** Are there programs where strategies are STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE, not just disfavored?
**Rationale:** Historical "4th degree" was FORBIDDEN, not just inadvisable.

### Test 3: Phase Transition Markers (STRONG)
**Question:** What grammatical features signal phase transitions at AZC boundaries?
**Rationale:** Historical sources emphasize "signs" at phase transitions.

### Test 4: OPPORTUNISTIC Program Structure (VERY STRONG)
**Question:** What structurally distinguishes "skillful operator" (judgment-critical) programs?
**Rationale:** Expert: "Compelling new axis."

### Test 5: Compatibility-Driven Pedagogy (EMERGENT)
**Question:** Is A-registry ordering governed by incompatibility topology, not just memory?
**Rationale:** Expert: "Bridges between incompatible regimes."

### Test 6: PREFIX Positional Bias (REFRAMED)
**Question:** Do control-flow roles show positional constraints within B programs?
**CRITICAL:** Frame as control-flow, NOT material flow.

### Test 7: Irrecoverability Audit (EMERGENT)
**Question:** Is irrecoverability a DESIGN FEATURE rather than limitation?
**Rationale:** Expert: "Deliberately constructed so identity cannot be reconstructed."

## Epistemic Safeguards

### ALLOWED
- Generate structural questions testable against Tier 0-2
- Treat M-A/B/C/D as control-space categories
- Find topological/graph properties
- Quantify positional biases
- Identify categorical boundaries

### FORBIDDEN
- Interpret M-A/B/C/D as literal materials
- Frame PREFIX gradients as "material flow"
- Decode tokens semantically
- Promote to Tier 2 without corroboration
- Assume historical parallels are explanations

## Success Criteria

- At least 4/7 tests produce significant findings
- No test contradicts Tier 0-2 constraints
- At least one new Tier 3 constraint generated
- M-C gap shows some distinguishing property
- Phase transitions have identifiable markers
