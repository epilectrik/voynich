## F-PWRE-001: Plant Affordance Necessity
Tier: F3
Status: SUCCESS
Scope: GLOBAL→PHYSICAL

Statement: The controller architecture implies 12 necessary physical affordances. Plants lacking any affordance cannot be governed by this controller.

Evidence:
- Continuous observability required (C171)
- Intervention points required (C366)
- Equilibration targets required (C105)
- Restart capability required (C182)
- Bidirectional transitions required (C391)
- Convergent state-space required (C074)
- Categorizable hazards required (C109)
- Kernel-mediated risk required (C107)
- Controllable hazard exposure required (C458)
- Categorical discrimination required (C469)
- Sparse compatibility required (C475)
- Type-based behavior required (C383)

Key Constraints: C171, C105, C107, C109, C182, C366, C391, C458, C469, C475, C383

## F-PWRE-002: Hazard Topology Compatibility
Tier: F3
Status: SUCCESS
Scope: C109→PHYSICAL

Statement: The observed hazard distribution (41% phase, 24% composition, 24% containment, 6% rate, 6% energy) is compatible with circulatory thermal and extraction/separation process archetypes.

Evidence:
- Batch thermal: ELIMINATED (energy would dominate)
- Chemical synthesis: ELIMINATED (rate would dominate)
- Mechanical assembly: ELIMINATED (no phase/composition)
- Biological cultivation: ELIMINATED (phase/rate mismatch)
- Circulatory thermal: COMPATIBLE (all 8 criteria met)
- Extraction/separation: COMPATIBLE (all 8 criteria met)

Key Constraints: C109, C110, C111, C112, C216

## F-PWRE-003: Two-Axis State-Space Model
Tier: F3
Status: SUCCESS
Scope: A+AZC→STATE_SPACE

Statement: Physical state-space is tracked via two orthogonal axes: Material Type (PREFIX, 4 classes) and Handling Requirement (MIDDLE, ~128 dimensions). Orthogonality (p=0.852) explains irrecoverability.

Evidence:
- Material type: 4 classes from 2×2 matrix (mobility × distinctness)
- Handling requirement: 1,187 unique MIDDLEs, 95.7% incompatibility
- Zone-material orthogonality: p = 0.852
- Hub MIDDLEs: 'a', 'o', 'e', 'ee', 'eo' (universal connectors)

Key Constraints: C383, C475, C469, Zone-Material Orthogonality (I.M)

---

## F-PWRE-004: Twelve-Class Exclusion
Tier: F3
Status: SUCCESS
Scope: GLOBAL→PHYSICAL

Statement: 12 major classes of physical processes are structurally excluded by Tier 0-2 constraints: one-pass batch, open-loop scheduled, observation-terminated, irreversible, non-equilibrating, quantitative ratio, precision measurement, stored-context, rate-critical, energy-dominant, substance-specific, continuous degradation.

Evidence:
- Each exclusion derived from specific Tier 0-2 constraint
- Exclusions are structural (logical necessity), not empirical
- Remaining space: circulatory, reversible, categorical, stateless, equilibrium-seeking

Key Constraints: C171, C391, C105, C182, C383, C469, C384, C109

---

## F-PWRE-005: Irrecoverability Is Architectural
Tier: F3
Status: SUCCESS
Scope: ARCHITECTURE

Statement: Substance identity irrecoverability is an architectural design feature, not a decoding barrier. Five structural barriers enforce it: axis orthogonality, sparse compatibility, no A-B coupling, categorical resolution, type-based behavior.

Evidence:
- Zone-material orthogonality: p = 0.852 (can't infer type from handling)
- MIDDLE incompatibility: 95.7% (can't infer from co-occurrence)
- No A-B coupling: C384 (can't trace across systems)
- Categorical resolution: C469 (can't recover parameters)
- Type-based behavior: C383 (same handling for entire class)

Key Constraints: C383, C384, C469, C475, Zone-Material Orthogonality (I.M)
