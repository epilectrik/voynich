# Phase PCIP: Plant-Context Intersection

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Mode:** SPECULATIVE — PLANT-CONTEXT INTERSECTION — NON-INSTRUCTIONAL EVIDENCE ONLY

---

## Objective

Test whether reliably identifiable plant illustrations contradict or preferentially support either extraction-type or conditioning-type product classes.

This phase does NOT:
- Treat illustrations as recipes or combinations
- Force borderline identifications
- Aggregate ambiguous plants into evidence
- Re-justify extraction dominance already shown structurally

---

## Prior Findings (Fixed Inputs)

| Source | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Phase PIAA | 86.7% aromatic-aligned illustrations (p<0.001) |
| Phase PPC | No program-morphology correlation (all p>>0.05) |
| Phase ILL | Illustrations are epiphenomenal (non-instructional) |
| Phase PCC | Both extraction and conditioning survive; extraction favored 5/5 vs 3/5 |

---

## Plant Identification Criteria Applied

Per instruction, a plant may be used ONLY if ALL four criteria are met:

1. Morphology strongly aligns with known medieval illustrations
2. Identification agreed by multiple independent sources OR functionally unambiguous
3. Historical use does NOT vary across major craft domains
4. Classification can be reduced to a use-category, not species name

---

## HIGH Confidence Identifications from Prior Work

| Folio | Use-Category | Proposed Type | Confidence |
|-------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| f38r | AF | Iris/orris type | HIGH |
| f9r | ALH | Umbellifer (fennel/dill family) | HIGH |
| f19r | ALH | Umbellifer (fennel/dill family) | HIGH |
| f9v | AF | Blue flower (larkspur/delphinium type) | HIGH |
| f49v | AF | Artichoke/cornflower type | HIGH |
| f11r | AS | Shrubby aromatic (thyme/myrtle type) | MEDIUM |

These 6 folios represent the strongest identifications available.

---

## Criterion #3 Failure: Historical Use Variation

**Critical finding:** All identified plant use-categories were historically processed via BOTH extraction AND conditioning.

### Iris/Orris (f38r)

| Method | Historical Practice |
|--------|---------------------|
| Extraction | Orris essential oil via steam distillation; orris butter via solvent extraction |
| Conditioning | Used in compound pomades, fixatives, digested preparations |

**Verdict:** BOTH methods historically used. **No constraint.**

### Umbellifers - Fennel/Dill Family (f9r, f19r)

| Method | Historical Practice |
|--------|---------------------|
| Extraction | Distilled for essential oils; aromatic waters (fennel water, dill water) |
| Conditioning | Used in compound cordials, digestive preparations, long-infused tinctures |

**Verdict:** BOTH methods historically used. **No constraint.**

### Blue Flowers - Larkspur/Delphinium/Borage Type (f9v)

| Method | Historical Practice |
|--------|---------------------|
| Extraction | Borage water via distillation |
| Conditioning | Used in compound preparations, preserved in honey/sugar |

**Verdict:** BOTH methods historically used. **No constraint.**

### Shrubby Aromatics - Myrtle/Bay/Thyme Type (f11r, f11v, f37v)

| Method | Historical Practice |
|--------|---------------------|
| Extraction | Bay oil, myrtle water via distillation |
| Conditioning | Used in compound oils, preserved preparations, long-cooked unguents |

**Verdict:** BOTH methods historically used. **No constraint.**

### Composite/Thistle Family (f49v)

| Method | Historical Practice |
|--------|---------------------|
| Extraction | Some composites distilled (chamomile water) |
| Conditioning | Used in compound medicinal preparations |

**Verdict:** BOTH methods historically used. **No constraint.**

---

## Summary: No Plant Category Provides Contradiction

| Use-Category | Extraction Compatible? | Conditioning Compatible? | Discriminates? |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| AF (Aromatic Flower) | YES | YES | **NO** |
| ALH (Aromatic Leaf Herb) | YES | YES | **NO** |
| AS (Aromatic Shrub) | YES | YES | **NO** |
| RT (Resinous) | YES | YES | **NO** |
| MH (Medicinal Herb) | YES | YES | **NO** |

**Zero plant use-categories were historically exclusive to one processing method.**

---

## Negative Evidence Check

What plants would CONTRADICT one class?

### Would Contradict Extraction-Type

| Plant Type | Example | Present in Manuscript? |
|------------|---------|----------------------|
| Plants NEVER distilled | Heavy resins requiring only digestion | NO — resins were also extracted |
| Plants degraded by any heat | None identifiable | NO |
| Plants used ONLY in long cooking | None identifiable | NO |

### Would Contradict Conditioning-Type

| Plant Type | Example | Present in Manuscript? |
|------------|---------|----------------------|
| Plants NEVER conditioned | Pure volatiles used ONLY fresh | NO — all aromatics were also conditioned |
| Plants destroyed by long heating | Some florals | INDETERMINATE — cannot reliably identify |

**No plant-based contradiction of either class can be established.**

---

## Why Criterion #3 Cannot Be Satisfied

Medieval aromatic practitioners routinely applied BOTH methods to the same plant materials:

1. **Rose** — Distilled for rose water (extraction) AND used in rose conserves, compound preparations (conditioning)
2. **Lavender** — Distilled for oil (extraction) AND used in compound waters, preserved preparations (conditioning)
3. **Iris/Orris** — Distilled and extracted (extraction) AND used as fixative in compound preparations (conditioning)
4. **Fennel** — Distilled for water (extraction) AND used in cordials, long-cooked preparations (conditioning)
5. **Bay/Myrtle** — Distilled for oil (extraction) AND used in compound unguents (conditioning)

The same materials served both purposes depending on:
- Desired product (water vs. compound)
- Available equipment
- Time constraints
- Customer requirements

**Plant identity does not determine processing method. Operator intent does.**

---

## What Plant Evidence DOES Show (Already Known)

| Finding | Source | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 86.7% aromatic-aligned | Phase PIAA | Already counted in model |
| Root emphasis (73%) | Phase PIAA | Already counted |
| Absence of food/dye plants | Phase PIAA | Already counted |
| No program-morphology correlation | Phase PPC | Already counted |

PCIP does not add new constraint because:
1. Aromatic alignment was already established
2. Aromatic plants were historically used in both methods
3. No species-level identification can distinguish methods

---

## Formal Conclusion

**Plant illustrations do not add decisive constraint beyond prior system-level compatibility analysis.**

---

## Rationale for Conclusion

1. **Zero plants meet all four inclusion criteria** — Criterion #3 (historical use doesn't vary) fails for all identifiable categories
2. **No plant-based contradiction** — No use-category was exclusively extraction OR exclusively conditioning
3. **Prior work already counted** — PIAA aromatic alignment is baked into PCC result
4. **No species-level confidence** — Even HIGH confidence is use-category, not species
5. **Dual-use is the historical norm** — Medieval practitioners applied both methods to same materials

---

## What This Analysis Does NOT Show

- Does not identify specific plants
- Does not prove manuscript purpose
- Does not invalidate extraction weighting from PCC
- Does not modify frozen grammar model
- Does not suggest PCIP was unwarranted (falsification attempt was valid)

---

## Stopping Condition

STOP triggered: **Plant identifications fail criterion #3 (dual historical use).**

Further plant-based reasoning cannot add constraint. This is a valid terminal outcome per instruction.

---

## Implications for Product Space

Product space remains as established in Phase PCC:

| Class | Status | Constraint Source |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Extraction-Type | SURVIVES (strong) | Phase PCC structural alignment |
| Conditioning-Type | SURVIVES (underconstrained) | Phase PCC structural alignment |

No modification from PCIP.

---

## Next Phase Status

Per instruction: "Proceed to Phase HCC only if exactly one product class survives PCIP."

**Both classes survive.** Phase HCC is NOT authorized without new guidance.
