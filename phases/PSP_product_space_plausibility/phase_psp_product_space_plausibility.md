# Phase PSP: Product-Space Plausibility

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Mode:** SPECULATIVE — HISTORICAL PRODUCT-SPACE PLAUSIBILITY — NO RECIPE OR INGREDIENT INFERENCE

---

## Objective

Define historically plausible product families that could be produced by practitioners operating a **closed-loop circulatory thermal system** under the recovered control logic.

This phase does NOT:
- identify a specific product
- decode illustrations
- infer ingredients or recipes
- choose between extraction vs conditioning

---

## Fixed Inputs (From Phase PCI)

**Surviving Umbrella Class:** CLOSED-LOOP CIRCULATORY THERMAL PROCESS CONTROL

Subspecies (undistinguished):
- Extraction-type circulation
- Conditioning-type circulation

**Frozen Control Grammar Properties:**
| Property | Value | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| LINK density | 38% | Phase 16 |
| STATE-C convergence | 100% | Phase 13-14 |
| Endpoint markers | 0 | Phase 19 |
| Hazard irreversibility | 100% bidirectional | Phase 18 |
| Boundary risk memory | CF-1 effect=0.622, CF-2 effect=0.338 | Phase IMD |

---

## Plausibility Filters

### A. Process Compatibility
- Requires circulation, not linear batch work
- Benefits from indefinite or repeated operation
- Does not need fixed measurements

### B. Risk Profile
- Failure is irreversible (loss, decomposition)
- Risk peaks at start/end or phase boundaries
- Over- or under-processing destroys value

### C. Sensory Judgment
- Evaluated by smell, taste, clarity, behavior
- Endpoint is *felt*, not declared

### D. Economic Logic
- High value relative to labor/equipment
- Justifies prolonged attention
- Often secret or restricted

### E. Historical Attestation
- Exists before or around manuscript era (~1400-1450)
- Evidence of practice without full procedural disclosure

## Candidate Product Families Evaluated

### 1. Aromatic Distillates (Waters)

Rose water, lavender water, orange flower water, etc.

| Filter | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A | **PASS** | Circulation (pelican/cohobation) is the standard method; indefinite operation until satisfactory fragrance |
| B | **PASS** | Volatile loss irreversible; over-heating destroys fragrance; phase boundaries critical |
| C | **PASS** | Smell is THE judgment criterion; endpoint is "when it smells right" |
| D | **PASS** | Very high value (esp. rose water); justifies prolonged attention; guild trade secrets |
| E | **PASS** | Documented from Arabic origins (Al-Kindi 9th c.); Brunschwig 1500; widespread medieval practice |

**Verdict: PLAUSIBLE**

---

### 2. Essential Oils (Concentrated Aromatic Oils)

Volatile oils extracted and concentrated via repeated circulation.

| Filter | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A | **PASS** | Cohobation (repeated distillation) increases yield; circulation beneficial though not strictly required |
| B | **PASS** | Volatile loss irreversible; decomposition from over-heating |
| C | **PASS** | Smell, clarity, consistency |
| D | **PASS** | Extremely high value per volume |
| E | **PASS** | Documented from Arabic practice; European production by 13th century |

**Verdict: PLAUSIBLE**

---

### 3. Concentrated Resin Extracts

Balsams, oleoresins, and dissolved resins (frankincense, myrrh, benzoin processing).

| Filter | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A | **PASS** | Circulation extraction for concentration; benefits from repeated passes |
| B | **PASS** | Over-heating degrades resin; charring irreversible; contamination permanent |
| C | **PASS** | Consistency, smell, clarity as sensory endpoints |
| D | **PASS** | High value (incense trade, perfumery bases, medicinal use) |
| E | **PASS** | Documented from antiquity; extensive medieval trade |

**Verdict: PLAUSIBLE**

---

### 4. Matured/Digested Preparations

Tinctures, elixirs, and compounds prepared via long thermal conditioning.

| Filter | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A | **PASS** | Thermal conditioning epitomizes indefinite operation; no endpoints, just "when ready" |
| B | **PASS** | Over-digestion destroys activity; irreversible degradation |
| C | **PASS** | Color, consistency, behavior are sensory judgments |
| D | **PASS** | Very high attributed value (medicinal, alchemical) |
| E | **PASS** | Pseudo-Geber, Ripley, extensive alchemical documentation |

**Verdict: PLAUSIBLE**

---

### 5. Stabilized Aromatic Compounds

Fixatives and preservatives for perfumery; compounds conditioned for shelf stability.

| Filter | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A | **PASS** | Circulation conditioning for stabilization |
| B | **PASS** | Over-processing destroys binding/preserving capacity |
| C | **PASS** | Behavior, smell retention tested sensorially |
| D | **WEAK** | Secondary product value; supports primary aromatics rather than standalone |
| E | **WEAK** | Often mentioned as part of other processes; less independently documented |

**Verdict: PLAUSIBLE (borderline)**

---

### 6. Medicinal Plant Waters

Therapeutic herbal extracts prepared by distillation.

| Filter | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A | **WEAK** | Many prepared by simple infusion/decoction; circulation not always required |
| B | **WEAK** | Failures often recoverable by re-extraction; less catastrophic than aromatic loss |
| C | **WEAK** | Often prepared by recipe with standardized amounts; less sensory-driven |
| D | **PASS** | Valuable; apothecary trade |
| E | **PASS** | Extensively documented (antidotaria) |

**Verdict: DEPRIORITIZE (3 WEAK)**

---

### 7. Pharmaceutical Syrups/Compounds

Sweetened medicinal preparations with defined consistency endpoints.

| Filter | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A | **WEAK** | Typically batch preparation with defined endpoint (right consistency) |
| B | **WEAK** | Often recoverable by re-cooking or dilution |
| C | **WEAK** | Recipe-driven more than sensory-driven |
| D | **PASS** | Valuable |
| E | **PASS** | Documented |

**Verdict: DEPRIORITIZE (3 WEAK)**

---

### 8. Distilled Alcoholic Spirits

Aqua vitae, brandy, concentrated alcohol.

| Filter | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A | **FAIL** | Linear batch collection with defined endpoint (collection of spirit fraction); incompatible with 0 endpoint markers and indefinite cycling |
| B | **WEAK** | Over-distillation produces harsh product but not total loss |
| C | **PASS** | Taste, burning quality |
| D | **PASS** | High value |
| E | **PASS** | Documented 13th c.+ |

**Verdict: ELIMINATE (A=FAIL)**

---

### 9. Fermented Products

Vinegar, wines, mead.

| Filter | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A | **FAIL** | Passive biological process, not active thermal control; fundamentally incompatible with control grammar |

**Verdict: ELIMINATE (A=FAIL)**

---

### 10. Crystallized/Precipitated Products

Salt, sugar, alum, mineral preparations.

| Filter | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A | **FAIL** | Requires phase change (liquid to solid); incompatible with CLASS_C phase instability failure mode |

**Verdict: ELIMINATE (A=FAIL)**

---

### 11. Separated Fractions (Rectification)

Distinct distillate fractions collected sequentially.

| Filter | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| A | **FAIL** | Requires linear collection of different fractions with defined endpoints |

**Verdict: ELIMINATE (A=FAIL)**

## Mapping to PCI Umbrella Subspecies

The 5 plausible families map cleanly onto the PCI subspecies:

### Extraction-Type Circulation
- Aromatic Distillates (Waters)
- Essential Oils
- Concentrated Resin Extracts

### Conditioning-Type Circulation
- Matured/Digested Preparations
- Stabilized Aromatic Compounds

---

## Common Structural Features of Plausible Families

All 5 plausible families share:

| Feature | Shared Value |
|---------|--------------|
| Circulation requirement | Essential or strongly beneficial |
| Endpoint definition | Sensory, not procedural |
| Failure mode | Irreversible (volatile loss, degradation, contamination) |
| Value density | High (justifies sustained attention) |
| Historical practice | Pre-manuscript with incomplete disclosure |
| Boundary risk | Significant (matches CF-1/CF-2 memory pattern) |

---

## What This Analysis Does NOT Show

- Does not identify a specific product
- Does not distinguish extraction from conditioning internally
- Does not use plant illustrations
- Does not infer ingredients or recipes
- Does not name specific materials

---

## Formal Conclusion

Based on structural compatibility with closed-loop circulatory thermal control, the Voynich system plausibly supported production within the following product families:

1. **Aromatic Distillates (Waters)**
2. **Essential Oils**
3. **Concentrated Resin Extracts**
4. **Matured/Digested Preparations**
5. **Stabilized Aromatic Compounds**

These 5 families reduce to the 2 subspecies identified in Phase PCI:
- **Extraction-type:** Waters, oils, resin extracts
- **Conditioning-type:** Digested preparations, stabilized compounds

---

## Phase Termination

Product space reduced to 5 specific families within 2 operational subspecies. Termination condition satisfied.

**Next phase authorization required:** PHASE PCC — Product-Class Convergence
