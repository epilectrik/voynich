# Family Syntax Significance Test Report

## Executive Summary

**FINAL VERDICT: H1_SUPPORTED**

> Family syntax has LIMITED, non-essential influence. Families are emergent patterns with weak structural basis.

## Test Results

| Test | Verdict | Key Finding |
|------|---------|-------------|
| FAMILY_SYNTAX_RANDOMIZATION | H2_STRONG_STRUCTURE | Large effect detected. Family syntax is FUNCTIONALLY NECESSARY. |
| FAMILY_LABEL_ERASURE | FAMILIES_NOT_STRUCTURAL | Families cannot be recovered from execution metrics. They are DESCRIPTIVE artifa... |
| CROSS_FAMILY_TRANSPLANT | HIGH_TRANSFERABILITY | Syntax transplants cause minimal degradation. Family syntax is INTERCHANGEABLE. |
| DEGRADATION_CURVE | SYNTAX_MARGINAL | Full perturbation causes <10% degradation. Syntax has MARGINAL impact. |
| SYNTHETIC_CONTROL | FAMILIES_WEAKLY_STRUCTURED | Real families have higher variance but within tolerance. Structure is WEAK. |

## Test 1: Family Syntax Randomization

**Iterations:** 10000

**Aggregate Effect Sizes:**
- Legality: d = 0.282
- Convergence: d = 2.331

**Kill Criterion:** Effect size < 0.2 = trivial

**Verdict:** H2_STRONG_STRUCTURE

## Test 2: Family Label Erasure

**Adjusted Rand Index:** 0.0867

**Interpretation:**
- ARI ~ 0: Families cannot be recovered (descriptive)
- ARI >> 0: Families reflect intrinsic structure

**Verdict:** FAMILIES_NOT_STRUCTURAL

## Test 3: Cross-Family Syntax Transplant

**Mean Degradation:** 0.0000
**Max Degradation:** 0.0000

**Verdict:** HIGH_TRANSFERABILITY

## Test 4: Partial Syntax Degradation Curve

**Baseline Legality:** 1.0000
**Total Degradation (0% to 100%):** 0.0000
**Half-life (Legality):** >100%

**Verdict:** SYNTAX_MARGINAL

## Test 5: Synthetic Family Generation Control

**Variance Ratio (Real/Synthetic):** 237.9718

**Interpretation:**
- Ratio ~ 1: Synthetic produces similar structure (artifact)
- Ratio < 0.5: Real families have lower variance (real structure)

**Verdict:** FAMILIES_WEAKLY_STRUCTURED

## Hypothesis Summary

| Hypothesis | Description | Signals |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| H0 | Syntax has NO causal role | 1 |
| H1 | Weak emergent structure | 2 |
| H2 | Functionally necessary | 1 |

## Interpretive Firewall

> All findings describe structural properties measured on textual data.
> No semantic interpretation of family content has been applied.
> Domain-specific language has been strictly avoided.
