  "verdict": "REJECTED - Section T has MORE FL (28.4%) than S/B (21.2%), not less. Suppression hypothesis is wrong.",
  "interpretation": "Section T is FL-enriched, not FL-suppressed. The gradient anomaly has a different cause (possibly restricted MIDDLE vocabulary or positional dynamics). Section T independently shows a suffix effect (p=0.038), similar to ch-FL, suggesting text-heavy monitoring contexts may have tighter FL-suffix coupling."
