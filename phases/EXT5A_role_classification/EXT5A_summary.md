## Narrative Summary

EXT-5A tested whether the surviving material-process pairs from EXT-4 represent final products, functional intermediates, platform reagents, or process-stability demonstrations. The answer is heterogeneous: the survivors include all three productive roles, with no Demonstration/Process-Stability states detected.

Two survivors—**Aurum Potabile** and **Mercurial Elixirs**—are demonstrably Final Products. These were not theoretical preparations; they were actually consumed by historical persons. Diane de Poitiers died from daily gold consumption. At least six Tang emperors died from mercury elixirs. This evidence proves that some surviving material-process pairs describe end-product creation for human consumption, not merely reagent preparation or alchemical demonstration.

The remaining survivors are Platform Reagents (Philosophical Mercury, Sal Ammoniac, Oil of Vitriol) and one Functional Intermediate (Antimony Preparations). This distribution suggests the OPS-compatible operational space includes both **product preparation** and **reagent enablement**—a signature consistent with a master alchemist's working manual covering complete workshop capability, rather than a narrow single-product recipe book.

## Key Findings

| Finding | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Role distribution is heterogeneous | CONFIRMED |
| Final Products exist among survivors | CONFIRMED (2/6) |
| Platform Reagents dominate by count | CONFIRMED (3/6) |
| Demonstration states absent | CONFIRMED (0/6) |
| Product identification justified | **YES** |

---

## Decision

> ✅ **Product identification phases remain justified.**

The presence of genuine Final Products—with documented consumption and deaths—means the manuscript CAN describe end-product preparation. Investigation should continue.
