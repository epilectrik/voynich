## Detailed Assessments

### 1. Aurum Potabile — FINAL PRODUCT

#### Historical Usage Pattern
- Francis Anthony (1550-1603) dispensed aurum potabile as medicine
- Prosecuted by Royal College of Physicians for unlicensed medical practice
- René Charbonneau (1677): "The king has asked for drinkable gold"
- Paracelsus listed it among "medicamenta comfortativa"
- Giovanni Andrea documented use by friars for psoriasis, ulcers, epilepsy

#### Consumption Evidence
- **Diane de Poitiers**: Died at 66 after daily consumption of "potable gold and other drugs"
- **Documented toxicity**: "auric fever," gastrointestinal irritation, kidney damage
- Historical texts stress *use* (medical consumption), not just *preparation*

#### Consumption vs Transformation
- **Consumed**: YES (documented medical administration)
- **Transformed further**: NO (end product)
- **Reused**: NO (consumed on administration)
- **Degradation concern**: Loss of dissolved gold is catastrophic

#### Hazard-Role Consistency
| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Months investment justified? | YES — gold is expensive; medicine commanded premium price |
| OPS restart intolerance? | YES — gold lost is gold lost; apparatus contaminated |
| Catastrophic loss fear? | YES — patron/patient waiting; gold is expensive |

**Verdict: FINAL PRODUCT (Tier 2)**

---

### 2. Mercurial Elixirs — FINAL PRODUCT

#### Historical Usage Pattern
- Chinese alchemy: explicitly for human consumption to achieve immortality
- *Danjing yaojue* ("Essential Formulas of Alchemical Classics") details elixir preparation
- Historical texts emphasize *use* (consumption) as the explicit goal
- "Final use" was NOT vague — it was consumption for immortality

#### Consumption Evidence
- **Qin Shi Huang**: First Emperor of China died at 49 from mercury elixir
- **Tang Dynasty**: At least 6 emperors died from elixir consumption
- **Emperor Ai (d. 365)**: "No longer knew what was going on around him"
- **Emperor Wuzong (d. 846)**: "Very irritable, losing all normal self-control"
- **Lady Dai**: Autopsy found "abnormally high levels" of mercury in organs

#### Consumption vs Transformation
- **Consumed**: YES (documented imperial consumption and deaths)
- **Transformed further**: NO (end product)
- **Reused**: NO (consumed on administration)
- **Degradation concern**: Mercury volatilization destroys batch

#### Hazard-Role Consistency
| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| 40+ days investment justified? | YES — imperial patronage; immortality stakes |
| OPS restart intolerance? | YES — apparatus contaminated; 40+ days lost |
| Catastrophic loss fear? | YES — emperor waiting; failure may be fatal to alchemist |

**Verdict: FINAL PRODUCT (Tier 2)**

---

### 3. Philosophical Mercury — PLATFORM REAGENT

#### Historical Usage Pattern
- Pseudo-Geber: "staple ingredient of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century alchemy"
- Used to make: resin of copper (copper(I) chloride), spiritus fumans (stannic chloride), butter of antimony (antimony trichloride)
- "First step in making the philosophers' stone"
- Historical texts stress *preparation* AND *use as reagent*

#### Consumption Evidence
- **NOT consumed** as an end product
- Consumed only when transformed into other preparations
- Function is as a REAGENT for subsequent reactions

#### Consumption vs Transformation
- **Consumed**: NO (not an end product)
- **Transformed further**: YES (used to make other compounds)
- **Reused**: YES (reagent across multiple operations)
- **Degradation concern**: Contamination ruins reagent capacity

#### Hazard-Role Consistency
| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Weeks-months investment justified? | YES — reagent is precious; one preparation supports many subsequent operations |
| OPS restart intolerance? | YES — contaminated reagent cannot be recovered; toxicity is lethal |
| Catastrophic loss fear? | YES — reagent is expensive, toxic, time-intensive |

**Verdict: PLATFORM REAGENT (Tier 2)**

---

### 4. Antimony Preparations — FUNCTIONAL INTERMEDIATE

#### Historical Usage Pattern
- Regulus of antimony: "used to further produce a philosophic double mercury"
- Path "taken to completion, it leads to the confection of The Philosopher's Stone"
- Kermes mineral: some medical use (Glauber, 1604-1670), but primarily alchemical
- Historical texts stress *further processing* toward greater alchemical goals

#### Consumption Evidence
- **Partially consumed**: Kermes mineral was used as medicine
- **Primarily intermediate**: Regulus was processed into higher preparations
- Dual nature: medical product AND alchemical intermediate

#### Consumption vs Transformation
- **Consumed**: PARTIAL (kermes as medicine)
- **Transformed further**: YES (regulus to philosophic mercury)
- **Reused**: LIMITED (specific alchemical pathway)
- **Degradation concern**: Incorrect calcination destroys compositional value

#### Hazard-Role Consistency
| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Weeks investment justified? | YES — intermediate toward higher goal; some medical value |
| OPS restart intolerance? | MODERATE — material partially recoverable; weeks of work lost |
| Catastrophic loss fear? | MODERATE — antimony less expensive than gold; time is main loss |

**Verdict: FUNCTIONAL INTERMEDIATE (Tier 2)**

*Note: Ambiguous case. Classified as intermediate because primary historical use was alchemical pathway, not medical consumption.*

---

### 5. Sal Ammoniac — PLATFORM REAGENT (Marginal)

#### Historical Usage Pattern
- Used as flux in metallurgy
- Used as mordant in dyeing
- "Common ingredient in preparation of mercurial remedies"
- Used to make aqua regia (with nitric acid for dissolving gold)
- Used to make Naples yellow, mosaic gold

#### Consumption Evidence
- **NOT consumed** as an end product
- Function is as a REAGENT/FLUX across multiple craft domains

#### Consumption vs Transformation
- **Consumed**: NO
- **Transformed further**: YES (into aqua regia, other preparations)
- **Reused**: YES (flux, mordant, reagent)
- **Degradation concern**: Dissociation if improperly sublimed

#### Hazard-Role Consistency
| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Months investment justified? | MARGINAL — base materials are cheap (urine, salt, soot); time is main investment |
| OPS restart intolerance? | MODERATE — time lost, not expensive materials |
| Catastrophic loss fear? | MODERATE — corrosive on sublimation; apparatus damage |

**Verdict: PLATFORM REAGENT (Tier 3 — Marginal)**

*Note: Survives only because time investment is substantial; base materials are essentially free.*

---

### 6. Oil of Vitriol — PLATFORM REAGENT (Marginal)

#### Historical Usage Pattern
- "Most important alchemical substance"
- "Used as a medium to react substances in"
- Used to make nitric acid, aqua regia
- Does not react with gold — allows working with precious metals
- "Central to late medieval alchemy for dissolving metals"

#### Consumption Evidence
- **NOT consumed** as an end product
- Function is as a REAGENT for reactions

#### Consumption vs Transformation
- **Consumed**: NO
- **Transformed further**: YES (medium for other reactions)
- **Reused**: YES (reagent across multiple operations)
- **Degradation concern**: Extreme corrosivity; apparatus damage

#### Hazard-Role Consistency
| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Days-weeks investment justified? | MARGINAL — shorter duration than other survivors |
| OPS restart intolerance? | MODERATE — apparatus damaged by corrosion |
| Catastrophic loss fear? | MODERATE — extreme corrosivity; physical danger |

**Verdict: PLATFORM REAGENT (Tier 3 — Marginal)**

*Note: Survives because of extreme hazard profile, not restart economics.*

## Critical Observation: Heterogeneous Role Distribution

The survivors do NOT represent a single homogeneous role class:

| Role | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Total |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Final Product | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| Functional Intermediate | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| Platform Reagent | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| **Total** | **4** | **2** | **6** |

**Key Finding:** The surviving materials split into:
1. **Consumable end products** (Aurum Potabile, Mercurial Elixirs) — actually ingested
2. **Process-enabling reagents** (Philosophical Mercury, Sal Ammoniac, Oil of Vitriol) — reused across operations
3. **Alchemical intermediates** (Antimony Preparations) — fed into further transformations

This distribution suggests the manuscript may document:
- A multi-purpose alchemical workshop
- Both reagent preparation AND product preparation
- OR preparation of reagents that ENABLE product creation
