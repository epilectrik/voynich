# EXT-5A Stop Decision Statement

**Phase:** EXT-5A (Terminal Gate)
**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Purpose:** Determine whether product identification phases should continue or stop

---

## STOP DECISION

> ✅ **"Product identification phases remain justified."**

---

## Rationale

### Evidence for CONTINUE

Two of the six surviving material-process pairs are demonstrably **Final Products** that were actually consumed by end users:

1. **Aurum Potabile (Potable Gold)**
   - Francis Anthony dispensed it as medicine
   - Diane de Poitiers consumed it daily until death
   - Kings requested recipes for personal consumption
   - Documented toxic effects (auric fever) prove ingestion

2. **Mercurial Elixirs**
   - At least 6 Tang Dynasty emperors died from consumption
   - Qin Shi Huang died at 49 from elixir consumption
   - Lady Dai's autopsy showed mercury in organs
   - Historical texts explicitly describe consumption for immortality

These are not theoretical products. They were **actually consumed by historical persons**, with documented deaths as evidence.

### Why This Justifies Continued Investigation

The presence of genuine Final Products among the survivors means:

1. **The manuscript COULD document product preparation** — not just reagent/intermediate work
2. **The operational grammar CAN describe end-product creation** — gold dissolution for medicine, mercury stabilization for elixir
3. **The OPS hazard topology IS appropriate for consumable products** — the stakes justify the fear

If all survivors were Platform Reagents or Functional Intermediates, the manuscript would document **process enablement**, not product creation. That is NOT what the evidence shows.

### What This Does NOT Mean

- ❌ Does not identify which specific product the manuscript describes
- ❌ Does not prove the manuscript focuses on any particular survivor
- ❌ Does not resolve whether the manuscript covers one product or many
- ❌ Does not interpret illustrations or assign token meanings

---

## Alternative Consideration (Rejected)

The alternative conclusion would be:

> ⛔ "Product identification should stop; the manuscript documents process-stable intermediates or platform reagents."

This is **rejected** because:

1. **Final Products exist among survivors** — 2 of 6 were consumed
2. **Platform Reagents enable products** — philosophical mercury is used to MAKE products
3. **The heterogeneous role distribution** suggests a multi-purpose workshop, not a pure reagent preparation manual

Even if some programs describe reagent preparation, others may describe product preparation. The grammar accommodates both.

---

## Caveat: Heterogeneous Role Distribution

The survivors split:
- 33% Final Products (2/6)
- 17% Functional Intermediates (1/6)
- 50% Platform Reagents (3/6)

This heterogeneity suggests the manuscript may not document a single product class. Possible interpretations:

1. **Multi-purpose workshop** — different folios for different purposes
2. **Reagent-to-product continuum** — reagent preparation enables product creation
3. **Master alchemist's working manual** — covers the entire operational capability

Future phases should consider whether the manuscript documents:
- A single product family
- A reagent preparation corpus
- A complete workshop capability (reagents + intermediates + products)

---

## Implications for Future Phases

### Allowed
- Investigate which product families the grammar best describes
- Compare program structure to historical product preparation methods
- Test whether programs cluster by role (reagent vs product)

### Not Allowed
- Name specific products (remains prohibited)
- Associate with illustrations
- Claim downstream applications
- Infer geography or institutions

## Confidence Assessment

| Finding | Confidence |
|---------|------------|
| Final Products exist among survivors | **HIGH** (documented consumption/deaths) |
| Platform Reagents exist among survivors | **HIGH** (documented reagent use) |
| Product identification justified | **HIGH** (Final Products proven) |
| Single product class identified | **NOT ESTABLISHED** (heterogeneous) |
