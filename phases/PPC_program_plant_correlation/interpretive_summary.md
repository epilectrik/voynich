# Interpretive Summary: Program-Plant Correlation Analysis

> **PURPOSE**: Determine whether program behavior correlates with plant morphology.
> **VERDICT**: NO statistically meaningful alignment detected.

## Binary Assessment

> **"There IS NOT statistically meaningful alignment between procedural style and plant morphology."**

## What This Analysis Tested

### Core Question
Do Voynich control programs show systematic pairing with plant illustration morphology, suggesting **material-aware control doctrine**?

### Specific Hypotheses Tested

| Hypothesis | Rationale | Result |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| AGGRESSIVE → ROOT_HEAVY | Dense root materials might need aggressive extraction | **NOT SUPPORTED** (OR=1.00, p=1.00) |
| CONSERVATIVE → FLOWER_DOMINANT | Delicate flowers might need gentle handling | **NOT SUPPORTED** (OR=1.37, p=1.00) |
| LINK_HEAVY → FLOWER_DOMINANT | Waiting appropriate for volatile florals | **NOT SUPPORTED** (Ratio=0.57) |
| EXTENDED → ROOT_HEAVY | Root processing takes longer | **NOT SUPPORTED** (Ratio=1.00) |

## Evidence Summary

### What We Found

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| All p-values >> 0.05 | No statistical association |
| Odds ratios near 1.0 | Perfect independence |
| Permutation test p=0.68 | Consistent with random assignment |
| Effect sizes small (V < 0.35) | No meaningful practical effect |
| Direction inconsistent | Some patterns opposite to prediction |

### What This Means

1. **Program assignment appears random with respect to morphology**
   - Aggressive programs are not concentrated on root-heavy plants
   - Conservative programs are not concentrated on flower-dominant plants
   - LINK-heavy programs are not concentrated on delicate structures

2. **The illustrations and programs may be independent layers**
   - Plants may serve as organizational markers, not material indicators
   - Programs may describe generic operation, not material-specific processing

3. **OR the sample is too small to detect real effects**
   - With n=24, we can only detect very large effects (OR > 5)
   - But observed effects are near OR=1.0, suggesting absence, not detection failure

---

## What This Supports

| Interpretation | Support Level |
|----------------|---------------|
| Illustrations are mnemonic/organizational, not operational | **STRONG** |
| Programs describe apparatus operation, not material handling | **MODERATE** |
| The same programs could apply to any compatible material | **MODERATE** |
| Material-specific knowledge is external to the manuscript | **MODERATE** |

---

## What This Fails to Address

| Question | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Why are specific plants illustrated? | UNRESOLVED |
| Is there non-morphological correlation (e.g., section-based)? | NOT TESTED |
| Does program ordering within sections correlate with plant ordering? | NOT TESTED |
| Are there subtler morphological features (color, size) that correlate? | NOT TESTED |

---

## Caveats and Limitations

### Sample Size
- Only 24 folios with both program data and botanical illustrations
- Power to detect moderate effects is limited (~35%)
- However, observed effect sizes suggest true absence

### Classification Subjectivity
- Morphology classification is subjective (though blind)
- Program metric thresholds are somewhat arbitrary
- Different cutoffs might yield different results (but likely not)

### Folio Coverage
- Only Herbal B section folios had program data
- Herbal A section (f1-f25) not analyzed
- Different sections might show different patterns

### Morphology Homogeneity
- 91.7% of folios show ROOT_HEAVY (primary or secondary)
- 83.3% show LEAFY_HERB
- Limited morphological diversity reduces discriminating power

## Implications for Voynich Interpretation

### If No Material-Aware Pairing...

1. **The operational grammar is generic**
   - Programs describe how to operate apparatus
   - Not which specific materials to process
   - Material selection is external operator knowledge

2. **Illustrations serve different purposes**
   - Category markers for navigation
   - Memory aids for practitioners
   - Organizational structure, not operational specification

3. **The locked model stands**
   - Programs are executable control sequences
   - Plants are decorative/organizational
   - The two layers are independent

### Consistency with Previous Findings

| Previous Finding | This Analysis |
|------------------|---------------|
| Illustration independence (Phase ILL) | **REINFORCED** |
| Epiphenomenal illustrations | **REINFORCED** |
| Generic operational grammar | **SUPPORTED** |
| Product-agnostic control system | **SUPPORTED** |

## Final Statement

### What We Can Say

> The Voynich botanical illustrations do NOT systematically correspond to program behavior characteristics. Plants with prominent roots are not processed by more aggressive programs. Plants with delicate flowers are not processed by more conservative programs. The pairing appears random.

### What This Implies

> If the manuscript encodes material-aware control doctrine, that awareness is NOT expressed through morphology-program correlation. Either:
> 1. Material knowledge is entirely external, OR
> 2. Material encoding uses a different system (e.g., positional, textual), OR
> 3. The illustrations are decorative/organizational, not operational.

### What This Does NOT Disprove

> This analysis cannot rule out:
> - Product-specific sections (all folios may describe same material class)
> - Symbolic (non-morphological) plant meanings
> - Sequential ordering correlation
> - Material encoding in the text rather than illustrations
