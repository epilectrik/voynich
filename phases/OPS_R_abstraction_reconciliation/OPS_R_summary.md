# OPS-R Summary

**Phase:** OPS-R (Post-Freeze Refinement)
**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Purpose

Answer one internal consistency question:

> **How can a non-repetitive, forward-progressing compositional grammar implement a closed-loop, stability-biased operational control system?**

---

## Answer

> **Surface grammar generates forward-progressing text that implements cyclic control in state space.**

The apparent paradox dissolves because:
- Token non-repetition ≠ state non-recurrence
- Compositional generation ≠ linear execution
- Surface variation encodes control parameters; latent cycles implement control stability

## Key Findings

| Finding | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Latent state equivalence ratio | 49:2:1 (surface → oscillation → attractor) |
| Dominant cycle order | 2 (universal across 83 folios) |
| LINK implementation | Class of trajectories (not constant operator) |
| LINK-CEI correlation | -0.7057 (strong dampening effect) |
| Human-track LINK proximity | 99.6% (cognitive load compensation) |
| Currier A/B comparison | NOT POSSIBLE (all Currier B) |

---

## Consistency Audit

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Does OPS-R contradict OPS-7? | **NO** |
| Does OPS-R require new primitives? | **NO** |
| Does OPS-R introduce semantics? | **NO** |

**OPS-R is VALID.**

## What OPS-R Establishes

1. Many-to-one mapping from surface tokens to latent states is formal
2. Loops occur in state space, not token space
3. LINK is a functional class, not a fixed element
4. Human-track compensates during waiting, not during action
5. Abstraction layer discrepancy is RESOLVED

---

## What OPS-R Does NOT Establish

- Token meanings
- Material mappings
- Product identification
- Historical context
- Currier A/B differences (data limitation)
