# Phase SSI: Speculative Human-Track Semantics

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Prerequisite:** Phase HTCS (coordinate function inference)
**Mode:** SPECULATIVE - all claims explicitly labeled

---

## Critical Disclaimer

**Everything in this document is speculative interpretation.** The structural findings (coordinate functions, positional clustering, LINK proximity) are established. The meanings proposed here are educated craft-level guesses about what an operator would plausibly be observing.

**Certainty level: LOW to MODERATE throughout.**

---

## Fixed Facts (Not Relitigated)

- Human-track tokens are 99.6% LINK-proximal
- They are consulted during waiting, not action
- They do not encode quantities, thresholds, or instructions
- The system is a continuous closed-loop reflux process
- Operator judgment is sensory and expert
- The manuscript intentionally withholds explicit criteria

---

## Apparatus Context (Speculative Frame)

If the operator is working a **pelican alembic or similar reflux apparatus**, during waiting periods they would observe:

| Observable | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Vapor rhythm | Steady wisps vs surging clouds vs quiet |
| Condensation | Regular drip vs irregular vs flooding |
| Liquid level | Stable vs rising vs dropping |
| Bubbling | Quiet simmer vs rolling boil vs violent surge |
| Clarity | Clear vs cloudy vs foaming |
| Circulation | Steady return flow vs sluggish vs blocked |
| Vessel warmth | Even heat vs hot spots vs cooling |

The human-track would help the operator **know where they are** in this space of observable states.

## Token Cluster Interpretations

### CF-1: SECTION_ENTRY_ANCHOR (124 tokens)

**Sample Tokens:** `sory, ckhar, cthar, daraiin, okan, cphar, sairy, kos, cfhol`

**Observed Behavior:**
- Concentrated in first 20% of section (mean position 0.329)
- 53% early-rate concentration
- Appear as section begins, then diminish

**Speculative Meaning (PRIMARY):**
> *"Circulation establishing"* — The system is warming up, vapor is beginning to rise, first signs of reflux are appearing. This is the "getting started" phase.

**Alternative Possible Meanings:**
1. *"Initial disturbance period"* — turbulence from startup, before steady state
2. *"Charge settling"* — material adjusting to heat, initial outgassing

**Why This Fits the Data:**
- Early section position = early process phase
- LINK proximity = operator is waiting for establishment
- Multiple tokens suggest differentiated states within "startup"

**Confidence Level:** MODERATE

**Caveat:** The specifics of startup phenomena vary by apparatus design. "Establishing circulation" is generic enough to cover most continuous reflux scenarios.

---

### CF-2: SECTION_EXIT_ANCHOR (126 tokens)

**Sample Tokens:** `teody, dcheo, dalchdy, yteor, dalol, ckhol, alchey, opaiin, alar, ykair`

**Observed Behavior:**
- Concentrated in last 20% of section (mean position 0.682)
- 54% late-rate concentration
- Appear as section approaches boundary

**Speculative Meaning (PRIMARY):**
> *"Approaching exhaustion"* — The current regime is winding down. Vigor is diminishing, circulation is slowing, the run is approaching natural completion for this phase.

**Alternative Possible Meanings:**
1. *"Transition imminent"* — prepare for next operational phase
2. *"Diminishing returns"* — extraction or conditioning rate falling off

**Why This Fits the Data:**
- Late section position = late process phase
- LINK proximity = waiting for transition trigger
- Differentiated vocabulary suggests degrees of "lateness"

**Confidence Level:** MODERATE

**Caveat:** "Exhaustion" vs "transition readiness" cannot be distinguished internally. Both would look similar behaviorally.

---

### CF-3: WAIT_PHASE_MARKER (1,158 tokens — the dominant cluster)

**Sample Tokens:** `ykal, shory, kor, sholdy, ytaiin, ykor, sory, ckhar, kair, chtaiin`

**Observed Behavior:**
- 99% show >50% LINK proximity
- Mean distance to LINK: 0.6 tokens (essentially adjacent)
- Pervasive throughout manuscript

**Speculative Meaning (PRIMARY):**
> *"Steady reflux in progress"* — The apparatus is running normally. Vapor is rising, condensing, returning. This is the "all is well, keep waiting" state.

**Alternative Possible Meanings:**
1. *"Circulation rhythm normal"* — differentiated by tempo (slow/medium/fast)
2. *"Hold position"* — qualitative descriptors of what "normal" looks like

**Why This Fits the Data:**
- Pervasive occurrence = default operational state
- LINK proximity = waiting is the correct action
- 1,158 tokens suggests fine-grained differentiation within "normal"

**Confidence Level:** MODERATE

**Caveat:** The sheer number (1,158 tokens) suggests this category may contain multiple sub-meanings we cannot structurally separate.

---

#### CF-3 Sub-speculation: What distinguishes 1,158 tokens?

If the operator needs 1,158 distinct markers during "normal waiting," these may differentiate:

| Possible Dimension | Examples |
|--------------------|----------|
| Tempo | slow simmer, moderate reflux, vigorous circulation |
| Quality | clear return, slightly cloudy, very cloudy |
| Stability | rock-steady, minor fluctuation, needs attention soon |
| Time marker | early waiting, mid-waiting, late waiting |
| Section identity | "you are in section H" vs "you are in section S" |

The 80.7% section-exclusive vocabulary (from Phase MCS) suggests **section identity** is the dominant differentiator, with qualitative observations secondary.

---

### CF-4: ACTIVE_PHASE_MARKER (4 tokens)

**Sample Tokens:** `*, f, p, x`

**Observed Behavior:**
- Only 4 tokens in this cluster
- Distant from LINK (mean 21.5 tokens)
- May be transcription artifacts or anomalies

**Speculative Meaning (PRIMARY):**
> *Uncertain — likely not meaningful as a semantic category*

The tokens `*, f, p, x` are either:
- Transcription markers (not original content)
- Rare anomalies
- Genuine but too infrequent to characterize

**Confidence Level:** LOW (possibly not a real category)

**Caveat:** Four tokens is too few to draw meaningful inference. This cluster may be structural noise.

---

### CF-5: REGIME_PERSISTENCE_MARKER (41 tokens)

**Sample Tokens:** `otear, oteol, dchaiin, otaly, cheody, okalal, air, oty, otaldy`

**Observed Behavior:**
- Form extended consecutive runs (max length up to 20)
- Mean run length 1.33 (highest of all clusters)
- Repetition indicates sustained state

**Speculative Meaning (PRIMARY):**
> *"Hold steady"* — The current condition should be maintained. Repetition reinforces: keep this going, don't change anything.

**Alternative Possible Meanings:**
1. *"Extended digestion"* — long, slow phase requiring patience
2. *"Time-marking"* — consecutive tokens serve as duration indicators

**Why This Fits the Data:**
- Run formation = repetition = persistence
- LINK proximity = waiting is still correct
- Different tokens may indicate different "hold steady" durations or qualities

**Confidence Level:** LOW-MODERATE

**Caveat:** Run formation could be scribal habit rather than semantic intent. But the correlation with specific tokens (not random repetition) suggests intentionality.

---

### CF-6: CONSTRAINT_APPROACH_MARKER (187 tokens)

**Sample Tokens:** `ykor, ckhar, ory, cphy, ckhor, chetain, cthal, ocheey, ytal, cheoly`

**Observed Behavior:**
- Constraint density increases AFTER token appearance
- Mean before: 0.98 → Mean after: 1.16 (18% increase)
- Precedes higher-constraint operational zones

**Speculative Meaning (PRIMARY):**
> *"Watch closely"* — The system is entering a zone where mistakes become more costly. Pay increased attention. A hazard-adjacent condition may be developing.

**Alternative Possible Meanings:**
1. *"Tightening margin"* — safe operating window is narrowing
2. *"Approaching critical"* — system moving toward boundary condition

**Why This Fits the Data:**
- Rising constraint gradient = increasing operational risk
- LINK proximity = waiting but with heightened vigilance
- Distinct from generic "waiting" by predictive quality

**Craft Plausibility:**
A medieval operator would absolutely want to mark *"pay attention now"* moments. This is tacit knowledge that experienced operators develop: recognizing when a routine wait becomes a critical watch.

**Confidence Level:** MODERATE

**Caveat:** The term "constraint density" is our structural measure. The operator would perceive this as "things are getting delicate" without formal quantification.

---

### CF-7: CONSTRAINT_EXIT_MARKER (193 tokens)

**Sample Tokens:** `sholdy, cthar, daraiin, oteor, otear, sair, oksho, rchy, far, chtor`

**Observed Behavior:**
- Constraint density DECREASES after token appearance
- Mean before: 1.17 → Mean after: 0.99 (15% decrease)
- Follows higher-constraint operational zones

**Speculative Meaning (PRIMARY):**
> *"Safe to relax"* — The critical period has passed. The system is returning to stable territory. Normal vigilance is sufficient.

**Alternative Possible Meanings:**
1. *"Passed the danger"* — hazard zone navigated successfully
2. *"Widening margin"* — safe operating window is expanding

**Why This Fits the Data:**
- Falling constraint gradient = decreasing operational risk
- LINK proximity = can return to routine waiting
- Mirrors CF-6 but opposite direction

**Craft Plausibility:**
Equally important to knowing when to pay attention: knowing when you can stop paying attention. Expert operators conserve vigilance for when it matters.

**Confidence Level:** MODERATE

**Caveat:** The relief of "passed critical" may not have been written down unless the author feared operators would remain unnecessarily tense.

---

## Cross-Token Differentiation

### Why CF-6 and CF-7 are not redundant:

| CF-6 (Approach) | CF-7 (Exit) |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Precedes constraint increase | Follows constraint decrease |
| "Danger ahead" | "Danger passed" |
| Heighten vigilance | Relax vigilance |

These are **directional opposites**. An operator in a rising-risk zone needs different mental preparation than one in a falling-risk zone.

### Why CF-1 and CF-2 are not redundant:

| CF-1 (Entry) | CF-2 (Exit) |
|--------------|-------------|
| Section beginning | Section ending |
| Establishment phase | Exhaustion phase |
| System ramping up | System winding down |

These mark **boundaries** at opposite ends of a section. They orient the operator within the larger structural sequence.

### Why CF-3 and CF-5 are not redundant:

| CF-3 (Wait) | CF-5 (Persist) |
|-------------|----------------|
| Generic waiting markers | Run-forming repetition |
| "Wait here" | "Keep waiting, don't stop" |
| Moment-marking | Duration-marking |

CF-3 marks individual wait points. CF-5 emphasizes **extended** waiting through repetition.

---

## Historical Plausibility Assessment

### Would medieval operators care about these distinctions?

| Distinction | Plausibility | Reasoning |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Startup vs steady-state | HIGH | Every apparatus operator knows warmup feels different |
| Approaching exhaustion | HIGH | Diminishing returns are sensory (slower drip, less vigor) |
| Watch closely vs routine wait | HIGH | This is core expert knowledge |
| Extended hold periods | MODERATE | Some processes require patience marking |
| Section identity | HIGH | "Where am I in this book?" is fundamental navigation |

### Would this be written down?

The human-track serves as **memory aid for experienced operators**, not instruction for novices. Why write it?

1. **Consistency across sessions** — Same terminology for same states
2. **Training standardization** — Apprentices learn the vocabulary
3. **Error prevention** — Don't confuse "watch closely" with "safe to leave"
4. **Interruption recovery** — After a break, find your place

The manuscript is a **reference**, not a teacher. It assumes the operator already knows what "watch closely" means in sensory terms.

## Global Synthesis: Qualitative State Vocabulary

### The Speculative Core Vocabulary (8 items)

| Label | Structural Function | Speculative Meaning |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **ESTABLISHING** | CF-1 (section entry) | System warming, circulation starting |
| **RUNNING** | CF-3 (wait marker) | Steady reflux, all normal |
| **HOLDING** | CF-5 (persistence) | Maintain current state, extended patience |
| **APPROACHING** | CF-6 (constraint rise) | Watch closely, risk increasing |
| **RELAXING** | CF-7 (constraint fall) | Critical passed, can ease vigilance |
| **EXHAUSTING** | CF-2 (section exit) | Run winding down, transition ahead |
| **SECTION_n** | Section-exclusive tokens | "You are in section H/S/B/etc." |
| **(CF-4 unclear)** | Active marker | Possibly not meaningful |

### Why Written Rather Than Oral?

**Question:** Why would an expert operator need these markers written down?

**Speculative Answer:**

1. **The vocabulary is private.** Unlike common craft terms, this manual uses a section-local encoding (80.7% exclusive). If the operator trained with oral instruction, they would need a translation key.

2. **The states are many.** 1,158 distinct WAIT_PHASE tokens suggest finer gradations than any oral tradition would name. The written form serves as an index.

3. **The author distrusted memory.** Continuous processes can run for hours or days. Human attention drifts. The written markers provide reliable anchor points.

4. **The manual is portable.** Oral tradition stays with the teacher. A written manual can travel to apprentices, buyers, or future operators.

5. **The author expected interruption.** Quire-aligned boundaries (from Phase PCS) suggest the operator sets the book down at predictable points. Upon return, the human-track tells them where they are without re-reading the grammar.

---

## Residual Uncertainties

| Question | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Why 1,158 distinct wait markers? | Section identity likely dominates; sub-meanings unclear |
| What exactly differentiates CF-3 tokens from each other? | Cannot determine without external knowledge |
| Is CF-4 meaningful at all? | Probably not (4 tokens, likely artifacts) |
| Do morphological patterns (prefix/suffix) map to meanings? | Tested in Phase MCS — no correlation |
| Could some tokens encode duration? | Plausible for CF-5 (runs) but speculative |

---

## Stopping Condition

Analysis stopped because:

1. **Additional meanings become repetitive** — All functions collapse to variations of "where in waiting"
2. **Speculation becomes free-floating** — Without craft vocabulary from external sources, we cannot distinguish between "slow simmer" and "quiet reflux"
3. **Distinctions no longer map to clearly different operator experiences** — Beyond 8 basic categories, further subdivision is arbitrary

**Interpretive saturation reached.**

---

## Confidence Summary

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Human-track tokens refer to waiting-phase states | HIGH |
| The 8-category vocabulary is approximately correct | MODERATE |
| Specific meanings (ESTABLISHING, etc.) are plausible | LOW-MODERATE |
| CF-4 is semantically meaningful | LOW |
| Token-level meanings can be further refined without external evidence | LOW |

---

## Final Statement

The human-track plausibly indexes **qualitative observable states** during the waiting phases of a continuous reflux process. The vocabulary is:

- **Position-oriented** (where in section, where in process)
- **Risk-oriented** (approaching critical, passed critical)
- **Duration-oriented** (hold steady, extended wait)
- **Section-identified** (private vocabulary per section)

It is **NOT**:
- Material-specific
- Quantity-encoding
- Instruction-giving
- Sensory-criterial

The operator reads the human-track to know **where they are**. They read the grammar to know **what to do**. They use their own judgment to know **when to stop**.
