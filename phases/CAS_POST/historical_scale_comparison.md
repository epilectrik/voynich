## Question

Does the Voynich's apparent scale (~1,800 catalog entries, 897 compositional codes) match documented historical operations?

---

## Known Catalog Sizes (15th-16th Century)

| Source | Products/Entries | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Bodleian remedy book (15th c.) | 314 prescriptions | Rawlinson c. 299, organized head-to-toe |
| Dioscorides *De materia medica* | ~1,000 medicines | From 600 plants; foundational pharmacology |
| Rossetti's *Notandissimi secreti* (1555) | 300 recipes | First Western perfumery book, published Venice |
| Papyrus Ebers (ancient) | 800+ prescriptions | 700 drugs listed |
| Cambridge medieval collections | 8,000 recipes | Across 186 manuscripts (~43/manuscript average) |
| 1488 apothecary inventory | 20 categories | Simples, conserves, syrups, waters, oils, etc. |

## The Voynich's Structural Scale

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Compositional codes (PREFIX x MIDDLE x SUFFIX) | 897 |
| Catalog entries (unique signatures) | ~1,800 |
| Classification folios (Currier A) | 114 |
| Operational folios (Currier B) | 83 |

## Documented Major Operations (15th Century)

### Santa Maria Novella (Florence)
- **Founded:** 1221 (Dominican monastery)
- **Pharmacy operating:** Since 1381
- **Key products:** Rose water (developed during Black Death), aromatic waters, medicaments
- **Documentation:** Library holds medieval recipe books
- **Scale:** Supplied monastery, Florentine nobility, and broader markets
- **Status:** Still operating; oldest continuously-run pharmacy

### Venetian Muschieri Guild
- **Founded:** 15th century
- **Significance:** First perfumery corporation in Western history
- **Products:** Perfumed waters, pastes, oils, powders
- **Supply chain:** Eastern aromatics (musk, ambergris, sandalwood, benzoin) via trade routes
- **Related guilds:** Saponeri (soap makers), venditori de polvere di Cipro (cypress powder)
- **Documentation:** Rossetti's 1555 manual (300 recipes); guild records in Venetian State Archives

### Court Apothecaries
- Noble courts (Medici, Este, Sforza) maintained dedicated operations
- Supplied medicines, perfumes, cosmetics, aromatics
- Kept detailed inventories for accounting

## Scale Assessment

### Verdict: PLAUSIBLE BUT EXCEPTIONAL

The Voynich's scale is:
- **Larger** than typical surviving recipe books (300-400 entries)
- **Smaller** than comprehensive multi-manuscript collections (8,000+)
- **Consistent with** major institutional operation

### Implications

1. **Major institutional operation** — Not a personal collection but workshop-level catalog
2. **Systematic documentation** — Compositional structure more organized than typical remedy books
3. **Guild-level operation** — Comparable to Venice's muschieri or Florence's Santa Maria Novella
4. **Expert-facing** — No remedial instruction suggests internal reference, not teaching manual

---

## Alignment with EXT-6 Findings

Previous institutional compatibility analysis (EXT-6) narrowed to:
- Goldsmith/assayer workshops (Central Europe 1400-1550, N. Italy 1400-1470)

This scale analysis is **consistent** with those findings:
- Northern Italy had documented large-scale aromatic/pharmaceutical operations
- Guild structures existed to support such operations
- Expert-facing documentation matches workshop internal reference pattern

## Tier Classification

**Tier 4 (EXPLORATORY)** — External historical comparison, no internal structural constraint derived.

This analysis provides context but does not constrain internal interpretation.
