## Additional Purpose Classes Tested

## Remaining Viable Purpose Class

**ONE class remains: Continuous Closed-Loop Process Control**

Specifically, the locked structural constraints further narrow this to:

| Narrowing Constraint | Evidence | Effect |
|---------------------|----------|--------|
| Closed-loop geometry required | G1 open flow = 93.5% failure (Phase L4) | Eliminates single-pass processes |
| Phase-stable materials only | CLASS_C = 100% PHASE_COLLAPSE (Phase L3) | Eliminates phase-change processes |
| Circulation geometry | LINK maps to recirculation delay (d=4.50) | Requires reflux or circulation |
| Indefinite operation | 0 endpoint markers | Eliminates finite-batch processes |
| Kernel control structure | k, h, e mandatory waypoint | Requires three-point regulation |

**The viable purpose is:**

> Control of a continuous, closed-loop circulation process with phase-stable materials, using sensory-based judgment for completion.

---

## What the Operator is Responsible For

In this viable purpose class:

1. **Fire/heat management** — Not encoded; assumed competent
2. **Sensory completion judgment** — When to stop (smell, color, clarity)
3. **Material selection** — What to process (external knowledge)
4. **Hazard recognition** — Physical signs of imminent failure
5. **Recovery initiation** — Recognize and respond to destabilization

The manuscript provides:
- WHERE in the sequence they are (navigation)
- WHAT to do at each step (instruction)
- What NOT to do (forbidden transitions)

The manuscript does NOT provide:
- WHEN to stop (external judgment)
- WHAT they're making (external knowledge)
- WHY it works (assumed understanding)

---

## Why Written Instruction Must Stop Early

In continuous process control:

1. **Completion is subjective** — No objective endpoint; quality is sensory
2. **Process continues after text** — Cooling, settling, aging not encodable
3. **Outcome varies by material** — Same program, different starting material = different result
4. **Expert judges quality** — Author cannot specify "good enough"

The text provides the operational sequence. The operator provides the judgment.

This is **structurally necessary**, not a deficiency.

---

## Why Navigation Matters More Than Explanation

In continuous process control:

1. **Expert knows the domain** — No need to explain what distillation is
2. **Hazards are internalized** — 17 forbidden transitions encode "don't do this"
3. **Position matters** — WHERE in the 75,248-instruction space am I?
4. **Memory aids unnecessary** — Expert remembers; book reminds

The 80.7% section-exclusive vocabulary serves as:
- Location marker (which section)
- Progress indicator (where in section)
- Recovery anchor (return to known position)

Explanation would waste space. Navigation enables work.

---

## Stopping Condition

**Stopping because:**

1. **Only one purpose class remains** — Continuous closed-loop process control
2. **Further narrowing requires semantics** — Distinguishing aromatic waters from medicinal extracts requires identifying materials
3. **Remaining distinctions untestable** — Whether this is perfumery vs pharmacy is materially identical structurally
4. **Structure alone cannot discriminate** — All continuous phase-stable circulation processes fit equally

The structural evidence **converges to a category**, not a specific practice.

---

## Final Verdict

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What class of human activity requires this structure? | **Continuous closed-loop process control** |
| What is excluded? | Language, recipes, taxonomies, calculations, rituals, education, discrete batch operations, phase-change processes |
| What remains untestable? | Specific materials, products, historical identity |
| Is this a successful outcome? | **YES** — narrow convergence to single viable class |

---

## Interpretive Boundary (LOCKED)

This analysis determines:
- ✅ What KIND of dangerous human practice fits
- ✅ What is definitively excluded

This analysis does NOT determine:
- ❌ What substance is processed
- ❌ What outcome is desired
- ❌ What success means
- ❌ Historical identity of practitioner

**Purpose category identified. Semantic content remains unrecoverable.**

---

*Phase PCI complete. Convergence to single viable purpose class achieved.*
