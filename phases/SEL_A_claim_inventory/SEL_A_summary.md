# SEL-A Summary: Claim Inventory & Necessity Audit

**Phase:** SEL-A
**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Key Findings

### Inventory

- **47 claims** cataloged from OPS-1 through OPS-R
- **18 formal**, 14 statistical, 12 interpretive, 3 eliminative

### Falsifiability

- **68%** hard-falsifiable (good)
- **28%** soft-falsifiable (requires attention)
- **4%** practically unfalsifiable (OPS5-07, OPS7-08 — closure declarations)

### Tier Downgrade Candidates

11 claims (23%) use interpretive language that exceeds Tier 2 bounds:

| Claim | Issue |
|-------|-------|
| OPS4-03, OPS7-06 | "Transient" implies design purpose |
| OPS5-06 | "Damping mechanism" from correlation |
| OPS6-05 | "Intentional" from significance |
| OPS6A-05 | "Assumes experts" (psychological) |
| OPS7-02-06 | Doctrine principles are interpretive |
| OPSR-04, OPSR-05 | Function assignment ("implements") |

### Pressure Points

1. **Unfalsifiable closures:** "OPS CLOSED" and "internal investigation closed" have no reopening criteria
2. **Absence-based eliminations:** "NOT detected" ≠ "does not exist"
3. **Semantic leakage:** "Purely structural" analysis uses semantic language
4. **Bundled claims:** Doctrine (5 claims) and reconciliation (5 claims) presented as units

### Robust Core

33 claims (70%) are methodologically sound:
- All OPS-1 and OPS-2 claims
- All Pareto analysis claims (OPS-3)
- All graph structure claims (OPS-4)
- All CEI construction claims (OPS-5)
- All null hypothesis tests (OPS-6)
- All effect size calculations (OPS-6.A)

## Audit Verdict

**The OPS/OPS-R corpus is methodologically sound at its core** (formal and statistical claims), but **23% of claims make interpretive assertions** about purpose, function, or design intent that are not structurally forced.

The model is now **more constrained** — interpretive claims are flagged but not repaired.

## Implications

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| 2 unfalsifiable closure claims | OPS scope is author-declared, not data-forced |
| 11 tier downgrade candidates | Tier 2 boundary is porous; some claims are Tier 3 |
| Root dependency on OPS1-01 | Single point of methodological vulnerability |
| Epistemic hedges undercut | "Purely structural" claim is compromised |

*SEL-A complete. No repairs proposed.*
