# Phase: B_EXCLUSIVE_GEOMETRIC_INTEGRATION

## Purpose

Confirm that B-exclusive MIDDLEs (900/1293 not in A's 972-MIDDLE space) are geometrically subordinate to the discrimination manifold, not architecturally independent.

## Binary Outcome

- **SUBORDINATE**: B-exclusive MIDDLEs are morphological elaboration tails riding on A PP backbone atoms. Single manifold. Architecture complete.
- **INDEPENDENT**: B-exclusive MIDDLEs create structurally distinct geometry. Second manifold exists. Architecture must be reopened.

## Prior Evidence Leaning Toward SUBORDINATE

- C792: 100% B-exclusive vocabulary = HT/UN identity
- C610: 90.7% of UN MIDDLEs contain PP atoms
- C618: 95.7% of unique MIDDLEs contain PP atoms
- C619: Unique MIDDLEs behaviorally equivalent to UN tail
- C621: Removing unique MIDDLEs shifts mean role only 2.8pp

## Tests

### T1: Residual Embedding Projection
Project B-exclusive MIDDLEs into the 100D A space using sub-component overlap.
- For each B-exclusive MIDDLE, find A-space MIDDLEs it contains as substrings
- Project as centroid of contained atoms in residual embedding
- Measure: distance to nearest A point, cosine distribution vs shared types
- If cluster near origin → non-discriminative elaborations
- If distribute like shared types → unified manifold
- If new directional structure → potential second geometry

### T2: Discrimination Fit
Test whether B-exclusive pairs respect A's incompatibility topology (C475).
- Build B-internal co-occurrence for B-exclusive pairs
- Compute incompatibility density, clustering coefficient
- Compare sparsity profile to A's matrix
- If alignment → same manifold indirectly extended

### T3: Role Distribution
Classify B-exclusive MIDDLEs by morphological and functional properties.
- Frequency distribution (how rare?)
- Morphological complexity (length, compound status)
- Sub-component overlap with A-space
- Confirm C792/C610/C618 predictions

### T4: Energy Functional Sensitivity
Compute E(line) with and without B-exclusive tokens.
- Compare E distributions
- If no material shift → B-exclusive are surface elaboration
- If shift → they are load-bearing tension contributors

### T5: Sub-Component Collapse
Using atom decomposition (C267.a / MiddleAnalyzer):
- Can B-exclusive MIDDLEs be decomposed to A PP atoms?
- What percentage share atoms with A manifold?
- If >=80-90% share core atoms → superstring variants of same axes

## Stop Rule

5 tests, then verdict. No extensions.
