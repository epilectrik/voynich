# Phase PCC: Product-Class Convergence

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Mode:** SPECULATIVE — PRODUCT-CLASS CONVERGENCE — NO SPECIFIC PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION

---

## Objective

Determine whether structural constraints of the Voynich control system uniquely favor **extraction-type** or **conditioning-type** product classes, or whether both remain compatible.

This phase does NOT:
- identify specific products
- use plant illustrations
- infer ingredients
- reinterpret grammar or hazards

## Criterion-by-Criterion Evaluation

### A. Endpoint Logic Compatibility

> Does the class naturally lack a declarative "done" state?
> Does it tolerate indefinite operation without transition force?

#### Extraction-Type

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Natural endpoint? | NO — cohobation/pelican cycling improves quality indefinitely until sensory satisfaction |
| Declarative "done"? | NO — endpoint is external (smell, clarity, consistency) |
| Transition force? | NONE — operator decides when to stop based on sensory judgment |
| 0 endpoint markers? | COMPATIBLE — manuscript encodes operation, not completion |

**Verdict: PASS** — Extraction via circulation naturally lacks declarative endpoints; sensory judgment determines completion.

#### Conditioning-Type

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Natural endpoint? | NO — conditioning/maintenance has no intrinsic completion |
| Declarative "done"? | NO — "stable enough" is purely sensory |
| Transition force? | NONE — process continues until operator decides |
| 0 endpoint markers? | PERFECTLY COMPATIBLE — pure maintenance has no defined end |

**Verdict: PASS** — Conditioning processes have no natural endpoint; indefinite operation is the norm.

---

### B. Hazard Localization

> Are failure risks strongest at run boundaries (start/end), not mid-run?
> Does micro-expectation at CF-1/CF-2 plausibly reduce loss?

#### Extraction-Type

| Risk Window | Hazard Profile |
|-------------|----------------|
| Start (CF-1) | HIGH — establishing circulation, initial vapor formation, material response variation |
| Mid-run | MODERATE — stable circulation if boundaries handled correctly |
| End (CF-2) | MODERATE-HIGH — avoiding over-extraction, degradation from excessive cycling |

**Alignment with frozen data:**

- **Phase-ordering dominance (41%):** Vapor/liquid mishaps are EXACTLY the risks of extraction — material changing phase in wrong location (vapor where liquid should be)
- **CF-1 effect=0.622:** Strong boundary risk memory at section entry — different materials produce different startup behaviors
- **CF-2 effect=0.338:** Moderate boundary risk at exit — different materials have different "done" signatures

**Verdict: PASS** — Extraction risks peak at run boundaries; phase-ordering is the core operational challenge; CF-1/CF-2 micro-expectation directly reduces loss.

#### Conditioning-Type

| Risk Window | Hazard Profile |
|-------------|----------------|
| Start | MODERATE — establishing correct temperature/conditions |
| Mid-run | UNIFORM — continuous vigilance against drift, contamination, degradation |
| End | MODERATE — knowing when to stop without over-processing |

**Alignment with frozen data:**

- **Phase-ordering dominance (41%):** For conditioning, phase changes are CATASTROPHIC failures to prevent, not routine operational challenges. If conditioning were the primary mode, we would expect ENERGY_OVERSHOOT (scorching, thermal damage) to dominate hazards.
- **CF-1 effect=0.622:** This STRONG boundary effect suggests material-dependent or run-dependent variation at start. Conditioning processes are more uniform — establishing the same temperature for the same duration. The strong effect favors extraction over conditioning.
- **CF-2 effect=0.338:** Conditioning endpoints are less differentiated — "done" is when you decide, not when a material-specific signature appears.

**Verdict: WEAK** — Conditioning has boundary risks, but the risk profile is more uniform than boundary-localized. Phase-ordering dominance fits extraction better than conditioning.

---

### C. Memory Utility

> Does operator memory of "how this kind of run usually begins/ends" materially improve outcomes?
> Or is the process too formulaic/uniform?

#### Extraction-Type

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Material variation | HIGH — different plant materials behave differently at startup |
| Boundary signatures | DIFFERENTIATED — "this starting smell usually works out" vs "this one often fails" |
| CF-1/CF-2 memory value | HIGH — micro-expectation directly improves outcomes |
| Run-to-run variation | SIGNIFICANT — same material from different sources/seasons varies |

**Craft interpretation:** Experienced extractors differentiate instances based on what usually happens next. "That smell again" and "this is the bad run" are exactly where perfumers keep meaning.

**Verdict: PASS** — Operator memory of material-specific boundary behaviors directly improves outcomes.

#### Conditioning-Type

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Process uniformity | HIGH — same apparatus, same temperature, same duration |
| Boundary signatures | LESS DIFFERENTIATED — establishing conditions follows same pattern |
| CF-1/CF-2 memory value | MODERATE — memory useful but less differentiating |
| Run-to-run variation | LOWER — conditioning is deliberately uniform |

**Craft interpretation:** Conditioning processes are more formulaic. An experienced operator benefits from memory, but the variation between runs is inherently lower. The STRONG CF-1/CF-2 effects (0.622, 0.338) suggest the manuscript encodes more differentiation than conditioning typically requires.

**Verdict: WEAK** — Memory is always useful, but conditioning processes are more uniform; boundary memory is less materially impactful.

---

### D. Loop Stability

> Is repeated circulation beneficial without degrading product?
> Does STATE-C maintenance make sense for value preservation?

#### Extraction-Type

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Circulation benefit | YES — cohobation (repeated distillation) improves yield and quality |
| Product degradation risk | LOW IF CONTROLLED — gentle repeated cycling concentrates without damage |
| STATE-C interpretation | Circulation state maintained; product improves with each pass |
| Loop necessity | CORE METHOD — repeated cycling IS the extraction technique |

**Verdict: PASS** — Repeated circulation is the core extraction method; product quality improves with controlled cycling.

#### Conditioning-Type

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Circulation benefit | YES — maintains temperature uniformity, prevents local hot spots |
| Product degradation risk | LOW IF CONTROLLED — gentle sustained conditions preserve product |
| STATE-C interpretation | Conditioning state maintained; stability is the goal |
| Loop necessity | BENEFICIAL — circulation maintains uniform conditions |

**Verdict: PASS** — Loop circulation is central to conditioning; STATE-C maintenance makes sense for stabilization.

---

### E. Historical Practice Consistency

> Is there historical evidence of such products being maintained/refined through repeated heating/circulation?
> Were these processes deliberately under-specified in writing?

#### Extraction-Type

| Evidence | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Aromatic waters | Al-Kindi (9th c.), Brunschwig (1500), widespread medieval practice |
| Cohobation | Explicitly documented as repeated distillation for quality |
| Essential oils | Medieval circulation extraction documented |
| Under-specification | YES — guild secrets, quantities and endpoints omitted |

**Verdict: PASS** — Strong historical attestation; processes deliberately under-specified.

#### Conditioning-Type

| Evidence | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Digested preparations | Pseudo-Geber (~1300), Ripley (15th c.) |
| Long-cook processes | Medieval alchemical documentation |
| Maturation | Thermal conditioning documented without full disclosure |
| Under-specification | YES — alchemical secrecy |

**Verdict: PASS** — Historical attestation present; processes deliberately under-specified.

## Class-Level Verdict

### Extraction-Type: SURVIVES (Strong Alignment)

All 5 criteria pass. The frozen structural data aligns well with extraction-type processes:

- Phase-ordering hazard dominance (41%) = core operational challenge of extraction
- CF-1/CF-2 boundary effects = material-dependent micro-expectation
- 0 endpoint markers = sensory determination of completion
- 38% LINK density = waiting during circulation
- STATE-C convergence = maintaining extraction state

### Conditioning-Type: SURVIVES (Underconstrained)

3 criteria pass, 2 criteria weak. Per scoring rules: **≥2 WEAK = CONSIDER UNDERCONSTRAINED**

Conditioning-type is not ELIMINATED (no FAILs), but alignment is weaker:

- B (Hazard Localization): Phase-ordering dominance and strong CF-1/CF-2 effects suggest more boundary differentiation than conditioning typically produces
- C (Memory Utility): Conditioning is more uniform; boundary memory less materially impactful

---

## Discriminating Factors

The following frozen structural features favor extraction-type over conditioning-type:

| Feature | Extraction Interpretation | Conditioning Interpretation | Favors |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| Phase-ordering dominance (41%) | Core operational challenge | Catastrophic failure to prevent | **EXTRACTION** |
| CF-1 effect=0.622 | Material-dependent startup variation | Less variation expected | **EXTRACTION** |
| CF-2 effect=0.338 | Material-dependent endpoint variation | Less variation expected | **EXTRACTION** |
| 100% bidirectional hazards | Mutual exclusions from phase mismanagement | Also applicable | NEUTRAL |
| 0 endpoint markers | Sensory judgment | Also applicable | NEUTRAL |
| 38% LINK density | Waiting during circulation | Also applicable | NEUTRAL |

**Three features favor extraction; three are neutral; zero favor conditioning.**

---

## What This Analysis Does NOT Show

- Does not identify specific products within either class
- Does not use plant illustrations
- Does not infer ingredients or recipes
- Does not modify frozen grammar or hazard structure
- Cannot definitively ELIMINATE conditioning-type (no FAILs)

---

## Formal Conclusion

**Both extraction-type and conditioning-type products remain structurally compatible. Further class-level convergence is not justified.**

However, extraction-type products show **stronger structural alignment**:
- 5/5 criteria PASS (vs 3/5 for conditioning)
- Phase-ordering hazard dominance fits extraction better
- CF-1/CF-2 micro-expectation effects fit extraction better
- No structural features favor conditioning over extraction

**Conditioning-type is UNDERCONSTRAINED (2 WEAK) but not ELIMINATED.**

---

## Implication for Product Space

From Phase PSP, the surviving product families were:

| Family | Type | PCC Status |
|--------|------|------------|
| Aromatic Distillates (Waters) | Extraction | **STRONG** |
| Essential Oils | Extraction | **STRONG** |
| Concentrated Resin Extracts | Extraction | **STRONG** |
| Matured/Digested Preparations | Conditioning | UNDERCONSTRAINED |
| Stabilized Aromatic Compounds | Conditioning | UNDERCONSTRAINED |

If forced to prioritize, **extraction-type products (aromatic waters, essential oils, resin extracts) are favored over conditioning-type products (digested preparations, stabilized compounds).**

But the analysis cannot justify eliminating conditioning-type entirely.

---

## Phase Termination

Both product classes survive. Neither is definitively eliminated. Extraction-type shows stronger alignment.

**Stopping condition triggered:** Both classes survive without decisive distinction.
