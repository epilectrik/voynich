# EXT-2 Elimination Log

**Phase:** EXT-2 (Historical Process Matching)
**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Purpose:** Explicit documentation of processes lacking real historical instantiation

---

## Elimination Criteria

A named process is classified as **Textual / Non-Operational (Tier 4)** if:
1. It exists only in allegorical or symbolic descriptions
2. It lacks evidence of actual physical practice
3. Its operational specification is too vague to constitute a real procedure
4. It is primarily a literary or philosophical construction

A named process is classified as **Marginal / Weakly Attested (Tier 3)** if:
1. Evidence of practice is incomplete or contested
2. Physical instantiation is unclear despite operational description
3. It may represent theoretical proposals rather than documented practice

---

## Eliminated Processes (Tier 4 — Textual / Non-Operational)

### 1. Philosophical Transmutation via Circulation

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Process Name | Philosophical transmutation, Great Work (opus magnum) |
| EXT-1 Class | U |
| Status | **ELIMINATED (Tier 4)** |

**Rationale:**
- Transmutation of base metals into gold was the stated goal of much alchemical writing
- No documented case of successful transmutation exists
- Descriptions often use symbolic language with no clear physical correlate
- The "Philosopher's Stone" as product has no physical instantiation

**Evidence of Non-Practice:**
- Modern chemistry: transmutation of elements is impossible by chemical means
- Period skepticism: critics like John of Rupescissa questioned the practice while still pursuing it
- Lack of archaeological evidence: no transmutation products have ever been identified

**Note:** This does NOT eliminate circulation as a physical operation (confirmed Tier 2). It eliminates the *goal* of transmutation as a real practice. The *process* of circulation was real; the *purpose* of transmutation was not achieved.

---

### 2. Purely Symbolic Circulation (Philosophical Work Without Physical Correlate)

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Process Name | Symbolic circulation, allegorical work |
| EXT-1 Class | U |
| Status | **ELIMINATED (Tier 4)** |

**Rationale:**
- Some alchemical texts describe "circulation" in purely symbolic terms
- References to spiritual purification, death and rebirth, etc.
- No apparatus or physical operation specified
- Functions as religious/philosophical metaphor, not laboratory procedure

**Evidence of Non-Practice:**
- Texts lack operational detail
- No apparatus specification
- Outcomes described in spiritual rather than physical terms
- Modern interpretation: these are literary/spiritual texts, not laboratory manuals

**Distinguishing from Confirmed Practices:**
- **Confirmed (Tier 2)**: Circulation in pelican vessel with specified apparatus and observable vapor behavior
- **Eliminated (Tier 4)**: "Circulation of the soul" or "spiritual purification" without physical correlate

---

## Marginal Processes (Tier 3 — Weakly Attested)

### 1. Circulatio Philosophica (Philosophical Circulation)

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Process Name | Circulatio philosophica |
| EXT-1 Class | A, U |
| Status | **MARGINAL (Tier 3)** |

**Rationale:**
- Described in alchemical texts with some apparatus specification
- Overlaps with confirmed circulation practices
- Distinguished by stated philosophical/spiritual purpose
- Unclear whether practitioners performed it differently from ordinary circulation

**Evidence Assessment:**
- Apparatus (pelican) is confirmed
- Duration claims (40 days, philosophical month) may be exaggerated
- Outcomes described in both physical and allegorical terms
- Some practitioners likely performed physical circulation with philosophical interpretation

**Verdict:** Cannot be cleanly confirmed or eliminated. The physical operation is Tier 2; the philosophical overlay is Tier 3-4.

---

### 2. Extended Athanor Operations (Multi-Month Durations)

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Process Name | Extended philosophical digestion |
| EXT-1 Class | D, U |
| Status | **MARGINAL (Tier 3)** |

**Rationale:**
- Alchemical texts prescribe operations lasting months or years
- Athanor apparatus is confirmed
- Whether practitioners actually maintained such operations is uncertain
- Resource requirements (fuel, attention) for multi-month operations were substantial

**Evidence Assessment:**
- Athanor is confirmed (Tier 2)
- Short-duration digestion is confirmed (Tier 2)
- Multi-month operations may be theoretical proposals
- No direct documentation of sustained multi-month practice

**Verdict:** Marginal. Short-duration digestion is confirmed; extreme durations are weakly attested.

---

## Classes with No Eliminations

### Class A: Closed-Loop Thermal Circulation

**Status:** All named processes confirmed (Tier 2) or marginal (Tier 3).

No processes eliminated. The core practice (circulatio in pelicano) is well-documented. The philosophical interpretation is marginal but does not invalidate the physical operation.

---

### Class B: Continuous Reflux Distillation

**Status:** All named processes confirmed (Tier 2).

No processes eliminated. Cohobatio, repeated distillation, and reflux operations are thoroughly documented in period sources with clear physical specification and apparatus.

---

### Class C: Volatile Aromatic Extraction

**Status:** All named processes confirmed (Tier 2).

No processes eliminated. Aromatic water production is among the best-documented medieval chemical operations, with extensive archaeological, textual, and commercial evidence.

---

### Class D: Thermal Conditioning / Digestion

**Status:** All named processes confirmed (Tier 2).

No processes eliminated. Digestion in its various forms (balneum mariae, fimus equinus, athanor) is fundamental to medieval chemistry and thoroughly attested.

Extended durations (multi-month) are classified as **Marginal (Tier 3)** due to uncertainty about sustained practice.

---

### Class I: Medical / Pharmaceutical Distillation

**Status:** All named processes confirmed (Tier 2).

No processes eliminated. Pharmaceutical distillation, aqua vitae production, and related practices are documented in medical treatises, apothecary records, and commercial documents.

---

### Class U: Alchemical Circulation Texts

**Status:** Mixed. See detailed analysis above.

**Confirmed (Tier 2):**
- Opus mulierum (extended cooking/digestion)
- Quintessence circulation (prolonged circulation of distilled spirits)
- Prolonged circulation as physical operation

**Marginal (Tier 3):**
- Circulatio philosophica (philosophical interpretation of physical circulation)
- Extended multi-month operations

**Eliminated (Tier 4):**
- Philosophical transmutation (goal, not process)
- Purely symbolic circulation (no physical correlate)

| Quintessence circulation | U | **Confirmed (Tier 2)** | Physical operation attested |
| Circulatio philosophica | A, U | Marginal (Tier 3) | Physical + allegorical overlay |
| Extended athanor operations | D, U | Marginal (Tier 3) | Duration uncertain |
| Philosophical transmutation | U | **Eliminated (Tier 4)** | No physical instantiation of goal |
| Purely symbolic circulation | U | **Eliminated (Tier 4)** | No physical correlate |

## What This Does NOT Eliminate

**EXT-2 does NOT eliminate any EXT-1 procedure class.**

All six EXT-1 survivor classes have confirmed historical instantiation:
- Class A: Circulatio in pelicano is confirmed
- Class B: Cohobatio and reflux are confirmed
- Class C: Aromatic extraction is confirmed
- Class D: Digestio is confirmed
- Class I: Pharmaceutical distillation is confirmed
- Class U: Operational components (opus mulierum, quintessence circulation) are confirmed

The eliminations within Class U affect **specific sub-processes** (transmutation goal, purely symbolic circulation), not the class as a whole.

---

## Epistemological Note

The distinction between Tier 2 (confirmed), Tier 3 (marginal), and Tier 4 (eliminated) is based on:
1. **Textual evidence** — whether period sources describe the practice in operational terms
2. **Apparatus attestation** — whether physical equipment is documented
3. **Archaeological evidence** — whether material remains support the practice
4. **Outcome plausibility** — whether described outcomes are physically possible

Tier 4 eliminations occur when:
- Described outcomes are physically impossible (transmutation)
- Descriptions lack operational content (purely symbolic)
- No evidence of actual practice exists
