# EXT-2 Narrative Summaries

**Phase:** EXT-2 (Historical Process Matching)
**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Purpose:** Bounded narrative for each EXT-1 class explaining historical instantiation

---

## Class A: Closed-Loop Thermal Circulation

### Nature of Historical Practice

Class A corresponds to a **well-defined single process family** practiced across both alchemical and pharmaceutical contexts from the mid-14th century through the 16th century. The core practice is **circulatio**—prolonged recirculation of vapors within a closed vessel (typically the pelican) without removal of distillate.

### Historical Reality Assessment

**CONFIRMED HISTORICAL PROCESS (Tier 2)**

The practice is documented in:
- John of Rupescissa's *De consideratione quintae essentiae* (~1351), which describes circulation in specially made glass vessels to remove elemental impurities from quintessence
- George Ripley's *Compound of Alchemy* (1471), which references circulation among the alchemical operations
- Hieronymus Brunschwig's *Liber de arte distillandi* (1500), which discusses circulation apparatus

The pelican vessel itself is attested through:
- Period illustrations (Ripley Scrolls, alchemical manuscripts)
- Detailed textual descriptions of construction
- Reference to its symbolic meaning (pelican feeding young from its blood)

Archaeological evidence for pelican vessels is limited, likely because they were specialized glass apparatus that rarely survived. However, the practice itself is unambiguously attested through consistent textual description.

### Process Variants

The class represents a **single core process** with minor variations:
- *Circulatio in pelicano* — circulation in the pelican proper
- *Philosophical circulation* — extended circulation with allegorical interpretation
- Quintessence refinement — circulation following multiple distillations

All variants share the defining feature: closed-loop vapor recirculation without product removal.

### What This Does NOT Establish

- Does not identify what substances were circulated
- Does not map to Voynich illustrations
- Does not assign specific products to this process
- Does not claim Voynich manuscript used this specific apparatus

## Class B: Continuous Reflux Distillation

### Nature of Historical Practice

Class B corresponds to a **family of related practices** unified by the principle of repeated redistillation (cohobatio) or continuous reflux. The key feature is that distillate is returned to the original material for re-distillation, either manually (cohobatio proper) or automatically (circulation/reflux).

### Historical Reality Assessment

**CONFIRMED HISTORICAL PROCESS (Tier 2)**

This is one of the most thoroughly documented medieval chemical operations:
- Pseudo-Geber's *Summa Perfectionis* (~1300) describes redistillation as a standard laboratory operation
- Taddeo Alderotti (1276) provides detailed apparatus descriptions including the serpentine condenser
- John of Rupescissa (~1351) prescribes seven-fold distillation for quintessence production
- Brunschwig (1500) systematizes the method with specific apparatus recommendations

Physical apparatus is well-attested:
- Standard alembics with receivers: extensive archaeological finds
- Serpentine condensers: described by Alderotti 1276
- Rosenhut still: documented from early 15th century
- Moorish head (caput Mauri): late 15th century innovation

### Process Variants

This class represents a **family of related practices**:
- *Cohobatio* — manual return of distillate for redistillation
- *Long reflux* — extended operation with automatic return (in pelican)
- *Seven-fold distillation* — prescribed multiple redistillations
- *Fractional distillation* — separation by temperature stages

The distinction from Class A (circulation) is technical: cohobation involves drawing off and returning distillate; circulation keeps vapor within the vessel without removal. In practice, the processes overlap and were often combined.

### What This Does NOT Establish

- Does not identify what was distilled
- Does not specify products or purity levels achieved
- Does not connect to Voynich content directly

## Class C: Volatile Aromatic Extraction

### Nature of Historical Practice

Class C corresponds to a **well-defined single process family**: the extraction of volatile aromatic compounds from plant material through hydrodistillation or steam distillation. This is the primary historical method for producing aromatic waters and essential oils.

### Historical Reality Assessment

**CONFIRMED HISTORICAL PROCESS (Tier 2)**

This process has the strongest documentation of any in the set:
- Originated in the Islamic world (Avicenna refined the condensing coil, 11th century)
- Rose water production documented in Damascus (13th century manuscript showing multi-unit plant)
- Transmitted to Europe via Spain and Italy by 12th century
- Brunschwig (1500) provides comprehensive coverage of aromatic water production

Archaeological and material evidence is extensive:
- Copper alembics for aromatic distillation widely found
- Rose water as trade commodity is documented in period records
- Apothecary inventories list aromatic waters
- Literary and culinary references confirm widespread use

### Process Variants

The class represents a **single core process** with variations in:
- **Scale**: small household to multi-unit commercial operations
- **Heat source**: direct fire, water bath, steam injection
- **Material**: different aromatic plants (rose, lavender, orange flower, etc.)
- **Apparatus**: standard alembic, rosenhut, Moorish head

All variants share: extraction of volatiles from plant material through aqueous distillation.

### What This Does NOT Establish

- Does not identify specific plants used
- Does not map to Voynich botanical illustrations
- Does not claim the Voynich manuscript is specifically about rose water or any identified product

## Class D: Thermal Conditioning / Digestion

### Nature of Historical Practice

Class D corresponds to a **family of related practices** unified by the application of prolonged gentle heat to materials in sealed or semi-sealed vessels. The defining feature is extended duration at controlled temperatures below boiling.

### Historical Reality Assessment

**CONFIRMED HISTORICAL PROCESS (Tier 2)**

Digestion is one of the oldest and most universal chemical operations:
- *Balneum mariae* (Mary's bath) attributed to Maria the Jewess (~300 CE)
- Standard operation in Pseudo-Geber's *Summa Perfectionis* (~1300)
- Horse dung digestion (*fimus equinus*) documented throughout medieval period
- Athanor (slow furnace) specifically designed for this operation

Physical apparatus is extremely well-attested:
- Balneum mariae: continuous use from antiquity to present
- Athanor: described in alchemical texts; illustrations survive
- Digestion flasks: simple equipment widely available

### Process Variants

The class represents a **family of related practices**:
- *Digestio* (Latin) — the generic term for prolonged gentle heating
- *Balneum mariae* — water bath providing maximum temperature of 100°C
- *Fimus equinus* — horse dung providing steady ~40-50°C for weeks
- *Athanor digestion* — tower furnace providing consistent heat from slow-burning fuel
- *Putrefactio* — initial decomposition stage (often precedes other operations)

These are distinguished by heat source and duration, not by fundamental process character.

### What This Does NOT Establish

- Does not identify what was digested
- Does not specify the purpose of digestion in any specific case
- Does not connect to Voynich content directly

## Class I: Medical / Pharmaceutical Distillation

### Nature of Historical Practice

Class I corresponds to a **family of related practices** unified by medical/pharmaceutical purpose. The core practice is the production of *aqua vitae* (water of life) and medicinal distillates for therapeutic use.

### Historical Reality Assessment

**CONFIRMED HISTORICAL PROCESS (Tier 2)**

This is thoroughly documented in period sources:
- Taddeo Alderotti (1276): detailed aqua vitae production with double distillation
- Michele Savonarola (~1440s): first dedicated treatise on aqua vitae (*De Conficienda Aqua Vitae*)
- John of Rupescissa (~1351): quintessence as universal medicine
- Brunschwig (1500): systematic coverage of medicinal distillation
- Apothecary records: confirm widespread practice

Physical apparatus and practice attested through:
- Apothecary laboratory layouts documented
- Medical treatises prescribing distilled preparations
- Archaeological finds of apothecary stills
- Commercial trade in aqua vitae by 14th century

### Process Variants

The class represents a **family of related practices**:
- *Aqua vitae simplex* — distilled wine (high-proof alcohol)
- *Aqua vitae composita* — alcohol infused with herbs before distillation
- *Quintessence extraction* — highly purified spirit through multiple distillations
- *Medicinal waters* — aromatic waters for therapeutic use
- *Cordials* — sweetened medicinal distillates

The unifying feature is therapeutic intent, not process character. Many processes overlap with Classes B and C.

### What This Does NOT Establish

- Does not identify specific medicines produced
- Does not specify which preparations were made
- Does not connect to Voynich content directly

## Class U: Alchemical Circulation Texts

### Nature of Historical Practice

Class U presents a **mixed picture**: some practices are operational (physically performed), while others are primarily textual/allegorical (described but not necessarily practiced as physical operations).

### Historical Reality Assessment

**MIXED — Tier 2 to Tier 4**

The class contains:

1. **Confirmed Operational Practices (Tier 2)**:
   - *Opus mulierum* ("work of women") — extended slow cooking/digestion derived from household practice
   - *Quintessence circulation* — prolonged circulation as described by Rupescissa
   - *Prolonged circulation* — extended operation for refinement

2. **Marginal/Weakly Attested (Tier 3)**:
   - *Circulatio philosophica* — philosophical circulation described in allegorical terms
   - Some variants of "philosophical work" with physical apparatus described

3. **Textual/Non-Operational (Tier 4)**:
   - Transmutation procedures aimed at the Philosopher's Stone
   - Purely symbolic interpretations of circulation
   - Allegorical descriptions without clear physical correlate

### Process Variants

The operational subset represents:
- *Opus mulierum* — practical cooking/digestion (confirmed Tier 2)
- *Quintessence circulation* — extended circulation of distilled spirits (confirmed Tier 2)
- *Prolonged circulation* — multi-day or multi-week circulation operations (confirmed Tier 2)

The textual/allegorical subset includes:
- Transmutation attempts described in symbolic terms
- "Great Work" (opus magnum) procedures
- Philosophical interpretations lacking clear physical specification

### What This Does NOT Establish

- Does not claim transmutation was achieved
- Does not identify specific alchemical goals
- Does not connect to Voynich content directly
- Does not validate allegorical interpretations as physical practice

## Cross-Class Observations

### Overlap and Distinction

Several EXT-1 classes share apparatus and operational features:
- **A and B overlap**: both involve redistillation; A emphasizes closed-loop, B emphasizes collection/return
- **A and U overlap**: alchemical circulation texts describe Class A operations
- **B and I overlap**: pharmaceutical distillation uses Class B methods
- **C and I overlap**: medicinal waters use Class C aromatic extraction
- **D and U overlap**: digestion is fundamental to alchemical "work"

This overlap is **expected**—the EXT-1 classes are procedural categories, not mutually exclusive historical traditions.

### Common Features

All confirmed historical processes share:
1. **Expert operation required** — no process is trivially operable
2. **Extended duration** — hours to weeks, not minutes
3. **Apparatus standardization** — specific equipment is named and described
4. **Temperature control** — different heat sources for different purposes
5. **Sensory judgment** — no quantitative endpoints prescribed

### What EXT-2 Does NOT Establish

- **No products identified** — processes are documented, products are not specified
- **No materials identified** — feedstocks are not determined from process
- **No Voynich connection** — EXT-2 maps EXT-1 classes to history, not to the manuscript
- **No ranking** — all confirmed processes are equally valid historical instantiations
