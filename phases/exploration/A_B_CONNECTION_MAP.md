## Unified Hypothesis: Complexity-Frontier Registry (CFR)

Currier A externalizes regions of a shared control-space where operational similarity
breaks down and fine discrimination is required.

This can be described equivalently as:
- a *variant discrimination registry* (craft view), or
- a *partitioning of continuous control space* (formal view)

**The relationship between A and B is structural and statistical, not addressable or semantic.**

## CLOSED TESTS (DO NOT RE-RUN)

| Test | Status | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| Hazard density correlation | CLOSED | Initially positive (rho=0.228), fully explained by frequency |
| Permutation control | CLOSED | p=0.111 (failed) |
| Frequency-matched control | CLOSED | p=0.056 (failed) |
| **Pre-registered low-freq MIDDLE** | **CLOSED** | **rho=-0.052, p=0.651 (FAIL)** |
| Forgiveness/brittleness | CLOSED | Inseparable from structural complexity |

**These tests are closed. Any future correlation must exceed frequency-matched baselines to be considered new evidence.**

## Interpretation: Complexity-Frontier Registry (CFR)

### Established Facts

1. **Vocabulary overlap reflects complexity alignment**
   - A and B share ~1,500 token types
   - High-frequency tokens appear in complex structures in BOTH systems
   - This creates apparent correlation that is NOT semantic linkage

2. **Hazard correlation is spurious (FALSIFIED)**
   - Initial test: rho=0.228, p=0.038
   - Permutation control: p=0.111 (failed)
   - Frequency-matched control: p=0.056 (failed)
   - **Pre-registered low-frequency test: rho=-0.052, p=0.651 (FAIL)**
   - Conclusion: No residual risk-specific signal

3. **Connection density correlates with complexity**
   - Clustered A entries: 18.89 avg B connections
   - Singleton A entries: 16.32 avg B connections
   - This reflects WHERE DISTINCTIONS MATTER, not danger

### The CFR Model

> **Currier A does not encode danger, procedures, materials, or outcomes.**
> **It encodes where distinctions become non-obvious in a global type system**
> **shared with executable control programs.**

- **Currier B** provides sequences (how to act)
- **Currier A** provides discrimination (where fine distinctions matter)
- **AZC** constrains availability
- **HT** supports the human operator

### What This Map Shows

This connection map reveals which A entries share vocabulary with which B programs.
Higher connectivity indicates regions where:
- Operational similarity breaks down
- Fine-grained distinctions are required
- The same vocabulary appears in complex executable sequences

This is **complexity topology**, not risk encoding.
