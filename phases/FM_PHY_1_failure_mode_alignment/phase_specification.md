# Phase: FM-PHY-1 (Failure-Mode ↔ Physics Alignment)

## Pre-Registration

- **Date:** 2026-01-13
- **Tier:** 3 (Exploratory, Non-Binding)
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Prerequisite:** PWRE-1 Complete

---

## Purpose

Test whether the Voynich hazard distribution is **natural** for circulatory thermal systems — not just compatible, but what such systems naturally produce.

**Core Question:**
> Do real circulatory thermal systems naturally exhibit this same hazard distribution?

Not just "some hazards", but specifically:
- Phase ordering as DOMINANT (41%)
- Contamination ≈ Containment (24% each)
- Rate and energy MINOR (6% each)

---

## Why This Is Now Legitimate

PWRE-1 established:
1. The hazard proportions are **diagnostic**, not generic
2. They exclude batch thermal, chemical synthesis, mechanical assembly, biological cultivation
3. Only circulatory thermal and extraction/separation survive

This phase tests whether surviving archetypes **naturally produce** this distribution.

## Voynich Hazard Distribution (Target)

From C109 (Tier 0 FROZEN):

| Hazard Class | Count | % | Description |
|--------------|-------|---|-------------|
| PHASE_ORDERING | 7 | 41% | Material in wrong phase/location |
| COMPOSITION_JUMP | 4 | 24% | Impure fractions passing |
| CONTAINMENT_TIMING | 4 | 24% | Overflow/pressure events |
| RATE_MISMATCH | 1 | 6% | Flow balance destroyed |
| ENERGY_OVERSHOOT | 1 | 6% | Thermal damage/scorching |

Additional properties:
- 65% asymmetric (C111)
- 59% distant from kernel (C112)
- 71% batch-focused / 29% apparatus-focused (C216)

## Test 1: Historical Operator Writing Analysis

### Question
What do historical sources say "ruins runs"?

### Methodology
- Survey early modern distillation/extraction texts (Brunschwig, Libavius, Geber, etc.)
- Extract documented failure modes
- Categorize into the 5 hazard classes
- Compare proportions to Voynich distribution

### What We Are NOT Doing
- Identifying specific substances
- Claiming the Voynich matches a specific historical process
- Decoding tokens

### Success Criteria
- At least 3 historical sources analyzed
- Failure modes categorizable into 5-class taxonomy
- Qualitative dominance pattern (phase > composition/containment > rate/energy)

---

## Test 2: Modern Engineering Failure Taxonomies

### Question
What do modern distillation engineering sources identify as primary failure modes?

### Methodology
- Survey process engineering literature on circulatory thermal systems
- Extract failure mode categorizations
- Map to 5-class Voynich taxonomy
- Compare quantitative proportions if available

### Success Criteria
- At least 2 engineering sources analyzed
- Failure taxonomy mappable to 5-class structure
- Ratio comparison possible

---

## Test 3: Comparative Process Class Failures

### Question
Do different process classes show different hazard dominance ratios?

### Methodology
- Compare failure mode distributions across:
  - Circulatory reflux
  - Batch distillation
  - Chemical synthesis
  - Extraction/separation
- Test whether Voynich hazard ratios are UNIQUE to circulatory systems

### Success Criteria
- At least 3 process classes compared
- Distinguishable hazard profiles per class
- Voynich profile matches one class better than others

---

## Hard Constraints

### MUST NOT
- Identify specific substances
- Name specific historical processes as "the" source
- Map tokens to apparatus parts
- Claim semantic decoding
- Modify Tier 0-2 constraints

### MAY
- Study failure mode distributions
- Categorize historical warnings
- Compare to engineering taxonomies
- Note qualitative matches
- Document as Tier 3 fits

## Deliverables

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `phase_specification.md` | Pre-registration (this file) |
| `historical_failure_analysis.md` | Test 1 results |
| `engineering_failure_taxonomy.md` | Test 2 results |
| `process_class_comparison.md` | Test 3 results |
| `FM_PHY_1_PHASE_SUMMARY.md` | Summary |

---

## Success Criteria (Phase Level)

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Historical sources categorized | ≥ 3 sources |
| Hazard ratio match | Qualitative dominance pattern matches |
| Process class differentiation | Different classes show different ratios |
| Engineering taxonomy alignment | Mappable to 5-class structure |

---

## Promotion Path

If hazard dominance ratios turn out to be **necessary** for certain plant classes (not just compatible), findings could be considered for Tier 2 promotion as **exclusions** (not identifications).

## Epistemic Safety Clause

> *This phase does not decode the Voynich Manuscript. It uses physics and historical operator knowledge to test whether the controller's structure is natural for certain process classes. All findings are Tier 3 unless they establish logical necessity.*
