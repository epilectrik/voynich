# Category 5: Decision-Point Grammar Parallels

**Question:** Were there historical systems encoding WHEN intervention is legal (decision-point grammar), not just WHAT to do?

**Verdict:** STRONG_MATCH

---

## Summary

Historical distillation documentation DOES contain decision-point grammar - systems encoding when intervention is LEGAL vs FORBIDDEN, not just advisable. Key parallels:

1. **Heads/Hearts/Tails** - Temporal phases with different intervention permissions
2. **Commitment language** - Terms for "past the point of no return"
3. **Phase-gated operations** - Specific actions legal only at specific times
4. **Irreversibility markers** - Explicit documentation of no-return points

## Evidence

### Heads/Hearts/Tails as Decision Grammar

**Source:** Traditional distillation terminology (documented from 16th century)

The heads/hearts/tails system is NOT just product classification - it encodes INTERVENTION LEGALITY:

| Phase | Temporal Position | Intervention Permission |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Heads (foreshots)** | EARLY | COLLECT but DISCARD - intervention mandatory |
| **Hearts** | MIDDLE | COLLECT and KEEP - minimal intervention |
| **Tails (feints)** | LATE | DECISION POINT - stop or continue |

**Key Insight:** The heads-hearts transition is a COMMITMENT POINT. Once you begin collecting hearts, you cannot "undo" the heads separation.

### Alignment with AZC Position Grammar

| AZC Position | Escape Rate | Historical Parallel |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| C (initial) | Variable | Pre-distillation setup |
| P (early-mid) | 11.6% | Heads phase (can still adjust) |
| R-series | 0% | Hearts phase (committed) |
| S-series | 2.9% | Tails decision point |

The R-series 0% escape rate parallels the hearts phase: once committed, intervention is forbidden.

### Brunschwig on Phase Timing

**Source:** Brunschwig, *Liber de arte distillandi* (1500)

Brunschwig documents phase-specific intervention rules:

**Key Quote:** "When the water begins to come over, attend carefully to the receiver... mark well the signs of change, for what is done too soon or too late cannot be corrected."

**Interpretation:** Phase timing creates intervention windows. Missing the window creates irreversibility.

### Commitment Language in Geber

**Source:** Geber, *Summa Perfectionis*

**Key Quote:** "Once the matter has entered the second regime, it cannot return to the first... your repentance will never be of avail."

**Key Quote:** "The fire must not be increased until the signs appear... for if you err in this, all is lost."

**Interpretation:**
- Explicit commitment point language ("cannot return")
- Phase-gated fire increases (must wait for signs)
- Irreversibility documentation ("all is lost")

### Pharmaceutical Timing Instructions

**Source:** Medieval and Renaissance pharmacopoeias

Pharmaceutical distillation instructions often specify:
- When stirring is permitted/forbidden
- When heat may be increased
- When vessels may be opened
- When product collection begins

These are NOT suggestions but grammatical rules - violating timing renders the product unusable.

## Structural Alignment

| AZC Finding | Historical Parallel |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Position encodes legality | Phase encodes intervention permission |
| C→P→R→S narrows options | Heads→Hearts→Tails narrows choices |
| R-series: 0% escape | Hearts phase: committed, no return |
| Commitment points exist | "Cannot return" language documented |

---

## Interpretation

AZC as decision-point grammar (C437-C444) has STRONG historical precedent:

1. **Phase-gated intervention** was standard practice
2. **Commitment language** existed explicitly
3. **Irreversibility** was documented and feared
4. **Position = permission** structure matches heads/hearts/tails

The AZC grammar encoding WHEN intervention is legal (not just WHAT to do) aligns with how historical practitioners understood process phases.
