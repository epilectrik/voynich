## Results Overview

| Category | Question | Verdict | Key Finding |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| 1. Material Behavior | Did historical systems classify by BEHAVIOR? | **STRONG_MATCH** | Tria prima (salt/sulfur/mercury) ARE behavioral categories |
| 2. Memory Art | Did technical manuscripts use memory optimization? | **STRONG_MATCH** | Medieval ars memoria (divisio/compositio) directly parallels A-registry |
| 3. Skill Practice | Evidence for practice during operational waiting? | **PARTIAL_MATCH** | Waiting periods documented; practice activities not directly documented |
| 4. Operator Strategy | Did sources encode strategies beyond temperature? | **STRONG_MATCH** | Degrees of fire encode strategy; 4th degree explicitly FORBIDDEN |
| 5. Decision Grammar | Historical systems encoding WHEN intervention is legal? | **STRONG_MATCH** | Heads/hearts/tails is decision-point grammar; commitment language documented |
| 6. Handling Taxonomies | Materials distinguished by handling independently? | **PARTIAL_MATCH** | Handling as dimension exists; true orthogonality not documented |

## Detailed Findings

### Category 1: Material Behavior Classification (STRONG_MATCH)

**Finding:** Paracelsian tria prima (salt/sulfur/mercury) ARE behavioral categories, not chemical identities.

| Voynich Class | Behavioral Property | Tria Prima Parallel |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| M-A | Mobile, Distinct | Mercury (volatile, changeable) |
| M-B | Mobile, Homogeneous | Sulfur (active, combustible) |
| M-C | Stable, Distinct | - |
| M-D | Stable, Homogeneous | Salt (fixed, permanent) |

**Interpretation:** Medieval material classification by BEHAVIOR (not identity) is well-documented. Our M-A/B/C/D taxonomy fits within this tradition.

### Category 2: Memory Art Parallels (STRONG_MATCH)

**Finding:** Medieval ars memoria techniques DIRECTLY parallel A-registry memory optimization (C487).

| Medieval Technique | Voynich Parallel |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Divisio (short retrievable units) | A-registry atomic entries |
| Compositio (building blocks) | MIDDLE coverage through combinations |
| Hugh's "step by step" | Novelty front-loading (21.2% early) |
| Numerical retrieval | Systematic enumeration |

**Interpretation:** The z=-97 finding (A-registry ordering) is NOT anachronistic - it follows documented medieval memory principles.

### Category 3: Skill Practice During Waiting (PARTIAL_MATCH)

**Finding:** Apprentices had waiting periods during long processes, but specific practice activities are not directly documented.

**Supported:**
- Fire-tending required continuous presence
- Waiting periods were substantial
- Activities had to be non-interfering

**Not Documented:**
- Writing/drawing practice specifically
- Connection to skill development during waiting

**Interpretation:** HT interpretation remains PLAUSIBLE but cannot be elevated without direct evidence.

### Category 4: Operator Strategy Documentation (STRONG_MATCH)

**Finding:** "Degrees of fire" encoded STRATEGY, not just temperature.

| Degree | Strategic Interpretation |
|--------|--------------------------|
| 1st | CAUTIOUS - maximum patience |
| 2nd | MODERATE - balanced intervention |
| 3rd | AGGRESSIVE - faster throughput |
| 4th | FORBIDDEN - causes irreversible damage |

**Key Quote (Geber):** "Your repentance will never be of avail."

**Interpretation:** C488 (HT predicts strategy viability) aligns with historical practice where material properties constrained intervention approaches.

### Category 5: Decision-Point Grammar (STRONG_MATCH)

**Finding:** Heads/Hearts/Tails system IS decision-point grammar.

| Distillation Phase | AZC Parallel | Intervention Permission |
|--------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Heads (foreshots) | C, P positions | Can still adjust |
| Hearts | R-series | Committed, 0% escape |
| Tails | S-series | Decision point |

**Key Quote (Geber):** "Once the matter has entered the second regime, it cannot return to the first."

**Interpretation:** AZC as decision grammar (C437-C444) matches how historical practitioners understood process phases with commitment points.

### Category 6: Handling-Requirement Taxonomies (PARTIAL_MATCH)

**Finding:** Handling as a dimension exists but true material-handling orthogonality is not directly documented.

**Supported:**
- Degrees of treatment existed
- Same material could have different handling for different purposes

**Not Documented:**
- Explicit 2D material × handling taxonomy

**Interpretation:** Zone-Material orthogonality may be a NOVEL feature of the Voynich system.

## Aggregate Assessment

### Confirmed Historical Parallels

1. **Material behavior classification** - Tria prima provides direct precedent
2. **Memory optimization in ordering** - Ars memoria tradition directly parallel
3. **Strategy encoding in fire degrees** - Beyond temperature, includes behavioral connotations
4. **Decision-point grammar** - Heads/hearts/tails and commitment language documented

### Partially Supported

1. **Skill practice during waiting** - Context supportive, direct evidence lacking
2. **Handling orthogonality** - Dimension exists, full separation not documented

### Novel Features (No Historical Parallel Found)

1. **Zone-Material explicit orthogonality** - May be unique to Voynich system
2. **HT as grapheme practice record** - Specific mechanism not documented

## Epistemic Status

All findings remain **Tier 3-4 exploratory**:

- **Strengthen interpretive plausibility** for M-A/B/C/D, C487, C488, AZC decision grammar
- **Do NOT enable semantic decoding**
- **Do NOT promote to Tier 2** without independent structural corroboration

## Recommended Follow-Up

1. **Guild archive research** - Direct examination of apprenticeship records for Category 3
2. **Pharmaceutical manuscript analysis** - Look for explicit material × handling taxonomies
3. **Memory art corpus expansion** - Additional sources on technical memory optimization
