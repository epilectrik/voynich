# Category 6: Handling-Requirement Taxonomies

**Question:** Did historical systems distinguish materials by HANDLING REQUIREMENTS independent of material type?

**Verdict:** PARTIAL_MATCH

---

## Summary

Evidence for handling-material orthogonality is INDIRECT:

1. **Degrees of fire** varied by material AND intended product (partial separation)
2. **Processing difficulty** was discussed, but usually material-bound
3. **Intervention protocols** showed some material-independence
4. **No explicit 2D taxonomy** (material × handling) found

## Evidence

### Degrees of Fire × Material

**Source:** Brunschwig, Libavius, pharmaceutical sources

Fire degree selection depended on:

| Factor | Influence on Fire Degree |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Material type** | Primary determinant |
| **Intended product** | Modifies choice |
| **Quantity** | Modifies choice |
| **Vessel type** | Modifies choice |

**Key Finding:** Same material could require different handling for different purposes. This is PARTIAL orthogonality.

### Galenic Degrees as Handling

**Source:** Humorism, pharmaceutical practice

Materials classified by temperament (hot/cold/wet/dry) to degrees 1-4:

| Degree | Handling Implication |
|--------|---------------------|
| **1st degree** | Gentle treatment safe |
| **2nd degree** | Moderate care needed |
| **3rd degree** | Careful handling required |
| **4th degree** | Extreme caution |

**Interpretation:** This is handling-focused but NOT orthogonal to material - the degree IS a property of the material.

### Voynich Zone-Material Orthogonality

The Voynich finding shows PREFIX (material type) and MIDDLE zone (handling requirement) as INDEPENDENT axes:

| Voynich Structure | Historical Parallel |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| PREFIX = material class | Material identity (simples) |
| MIDDLE zone = handling | Fire degree / treatment intensity |
| These are orthogonal | Partial evidence only |

---

## Gaps in Evidence

1. **No explicit 2D taxonomy** found in historical sources
2. **Handling usually material-bound** - not truly independent
3. **Zone concept** may be novel to Voynich system

---

## Interpretation

Evidence is PARTIAL:

**SUPPORTED:**
- Handling requirements were a recognized dimension
- Same material could have different handling for different purposes
- Degrees of treatment existed independently of identity

**NOT DOCUMENTED:**
- Explicit handling × material orthogonality
- Zone-based handling taxonomy separate from material identity

This finding may represent a NOVEL feature of the Voynich system rather than a historical parallel.
