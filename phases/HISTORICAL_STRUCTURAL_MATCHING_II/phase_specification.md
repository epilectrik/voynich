# Phase: HISTORICAL_STRUCTURAL_MATCHING_II

## Pre-Registration

**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Tier:** 3-4 (Exploratory)
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Purpose

Find historical parallels for SPECIFIC STRUCTURAL FEATURES discovered in recent phases, particularly:
- C485: Grammar minimality (necessity proofs)
- C487: Memory optimization (z=-97 proven intentional)
- M-A/B/C/D: Material behavior taxonomy
- C488: HT predicts strategy viability
- AZC as decision-point grammar

## Research Categories

### Category 1: Material Behavior Classification
**Question:** Did historical systems classify materials by BEHAVIORAL PROPERTIES (mobile/stable, distinct/homogeneous)?
**Testable Prediction:** 3-4 major groupings emphasizing HANDLING over IDENTITY
**Sources:** Paracelsus, Galen, Brunschwig, guild inventories

### Category 2: Memory Art Parallels
**Question:** Did technical manuscripts use memory optimization techniques?
**Testable Prediction:** Documented ordering principles, novelty front-loading, difficulty curves
**Sources:** Carruthers, ars memoria tradition, guild curricula

### Category 3: Skill Practice During Waiting
**Question:** Evidence for structured practice during operational pauses?
**Testable Prediction:** Documentation of apprentice activities during long processes
**Sources:** Guild records, apprenticeship contracts, workshop documentation

### Category 4: Operator Strategy Documentation
**Question:** Did sources encode strategies (cautious/aggressive) beyond temperature?
**Testable Prediction:** "Degrees of fire" with behavioral/strategic connotations
**Sources:** Brunschwig, Libavius, Geber, pharmaceutical instructions

### Category 5: Decision-Point Grammar
**Question:** Historical systems encoding WHEN intervention is legal?
**Testable Prediction:** Phase-gated documentation, commitment language
**Sources:** Distillation procedures, pharmaceutical timing, alchemical phases

### Category 6: Handling-Requirement Taxonomies
**Question:** Materials distinguished by handling independent of type?
**Testable Prediction:** Material × handling separation in historical sources
**Sources:** Craft documentation, processing difficulty discussions

## Epistemic Safeguards

**CAN DO:**
- Find structural parallels at behavioral level
- Strengthen/weaken interpretive plausibility
- Document informative negative results

**CANNOT DO:**
- Decode specific tokens
- Identify specific substances
- Promote findings to Tier 2
- Claim definitive historical identification

## Success Criteria

- At least 2 categories show STRONG_MATCH
- No category shows CONTRADICTED
- Sources are primary or authoritative secondary
- Matches are structural/behavioral, not semantic

## Rating Scale

- **STRONG_MATCH:** Multiple sources confirm structural parallel
- **PARTIAL_MATCH:** Some evidence, incomplete alignment
- **NO_MATCH:** No relevant evidence found
- **CONTRADICTED:** Evidence actively contradicts expectation
