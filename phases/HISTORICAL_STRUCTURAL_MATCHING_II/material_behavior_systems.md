# Category 1: Material Behavior Classification

**Question:** Did historical systems classify materials by BEHAVIORAL PROPERTIES rather than identity?

**Verdict:** STRONG_MATCH

---

## Summary

Medieval material classification systems DID classify by behavioral properties, not chemical identity. Two major systems align with our M-A/B/C/D taxonomy:

1. **Paracelsian Tria Prima** (salt/sulfur/mercury) - 3 behavioral categories
2. **Galenic Four Qualities** (hot/cold/wet/dry) - 4 property axes with 4 degrees each

## Evidence

### Tria Prima (Paracelsus, 1493-1541)

**Source:** [Cabinet Oxford - Tria Prima](https://www.cabinet.ox.ac.uk/alchemy-four-elements-and-tria-prima)

The tria prima are NOT chemical identities but behavioral archetypes:

| Principle | Behavioral Property | Physical Manifestation |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Salt** | Fixity, stability, non-volatility | Body, solid residue, permanence |
| **Sulfur** | Combustibility, reactivity | Soul, transformation, activity |
| **Mercury** | Volatility, fluidity, changeability | Spirit, vaporization, movement |

**Key Quote:** "The text illustrates this through wood combustion: 'the fire was the work of sulphur, smoke of mercury, and the residual ash of salt.' This demonstrates how each substance encodes a distinct behavioral tendency rather than chemical identity."

### Alignment with M-A/B/C/D

| Voynich Class | Properties | Tria Prima Parallel |
|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| M-A | Mobile, Distinct | Mercury (volatile, changeable) |
| M-B | Mobile, Homogeneous | Sulfur (active, combustible) |
| M-C | Stable, Distinct | - |
| M-D | Stable, Homogeneous | Salt (fixed, permanent) |

The tria prima provide 3 of our 4 categories. The 4th (M-C: stable but distinct) may not have a direct parallel, or may represent a medieval category not yet identified.

### Galenic Four Qualities

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Humorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism), [Cabinet Oxford - Four Humours](https://www.cabinet.ox.ac.uk/four-humours-galenic-medicine)

Materials classified by temperament - mixture of hot/cold/wet/dry qualities:

| Quality Axis | Degrees | Example |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Hot-Cold | 1st through 4th | Pepper = "hot and dry to the fourth degree" |
| Wet-Dry | 1st through 4th | Patient treated by "contrary" remedy |

**Key Quote:** "The notion of temperament was fundamental for theoretical and practical medical branches... It defines the physical constitution of all living beings as well as food, drugs, and natural things in general."

This system dominated Western medicine from antiquity through the 18th century.

### Al-Kindī's Mathematical Degrees

**Source:** [NCBI - Medieval Mediterranean Pharmacology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK606146/)

Al-Kindī (d. 873) created mathematical rules for calculating degrees of primary qualities in composite drugs - a quantified behavioral classification system.

## Structural Alignment with Voynich

| Feature | Historical Systems | Voynich M-A/B/C/D |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Classification basis | Behavioral properties | Behavioral properties |
| Number of major categories | 3-4 | 4 |
| Emphasis on handling | Yes (degrees determine treatment) | Yes (zone survival profiles) |
| Identity irrecoverable from class | Yes (many substances share category) | Yes (by design) |

---

## Interpretation

The Voynich material behavior taxonomy (M-A/B/C/D) has STRONG historical precedent. Medieval practitioners DID classify materials by:

- **Phase mobility** (volatile vs fixed) = Mercury vs Salt axis
- **Reactive behavior** (active vs stable) = Sulfur vs Salt axis
- **Handling requirements** (degrees of hot/cold determine treatment)

This supports the interpretation that the Voynich manuscript uses a pre-modern, behavior-based material taxonomy rather than modern chemical identity.
