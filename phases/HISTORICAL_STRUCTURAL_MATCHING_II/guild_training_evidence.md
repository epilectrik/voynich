# Category 3: Skill Practice During Operational Waiting

**Question:** Is there historical evidence for apprentices practicing skills during operational waiting periods?

**Verdict:** PARTIAL_MATCH

---

## Summary

Evidence for structured skill practice during operational waiting is INDIRECT but supportive:

1. **Apprentices tended apparatus** during long processes (documented)
2. **Fire-tending** was a primary apprentice duty (documented)
3. **Writing/drawing practice** during waiting periods is NOT directly documented
4. **Silent, non-interfering activities** were implicitly required

---

## Evidence

### Apprentice Apparatus Duties

**Source:** Guild records, apprenticeship contracts (15th-16th century)

Apprentices were responsible for:

| Duty | Time Required | Attention Level |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Fire-tending** | Continuous | Active monitoring |
| **Material watching** | Variable | Passive observation |
| **Apparatus cleaning** | Between runs | Full attention |
| **Product separation** | Phase-specific | Critical timing |

**Key Finding:** Long distillation runs required continuous presence but NOT continuous activity. Apprentices had substantial waiting time.

### What Activities Were Permitted?

Historical sources do NOT explicitly document what apprentices did during waiting. However:

**Constraints on waiting activities:**
1. Must not interfere with apparatus
2. Must remain alert to phase changes
3. Must be quiet (conversation could distract)
4. Must be stationary (cannot leave apparatus)

**Compatible activities:**
- Writing practice
- Drawing/calligraphy
- Memorization
- Quiet contemplation

### HT Interpretation Support

If HT represents skill practice during operational waiting:

| HT Finding | Historical Alignment |
|------------|---------------------|
| Rare grapheme over-representation (3.29x) | Practice of difficult forms |
| Fixed-block run structure (CV=0.43) | Deliberate practice blocks |
| Hazard avoidance (0/35 at forbidden seams) | Stops when attention needed |
| Phase synchronization (V=0.136) | Tracks procedural phase |

The HT characteristics are CONSISTENT with waiting-period practice, even though direct documentation is lacking.

### Craft Training Context

**Source:** Pamela Smith, *The Body of the Artisan* (2004)

Medieval craft training emphasized:
- **Learning by doing** - Hands-on practice essential
- **Embodied knowledge** - Skills learned through repetition
- **Master-apprentice proximity** - Apprentices present during all operations

**Interpretation:** The training context SUPPORTS structured practice during operational presence, even without explicit documentation of writing practice specifically.

---

## Gaps in Evidence

1. **No direct documentation** of writing/drawing during distillation waiting
2. **Guild records** focus on duties, not waiting activities
3. **Craft secrecy** may have limited documentation of practice methods

---

## Structural Alignment

| HT Interpretation | Historical Evidence |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Practice during waiting | Waiting periods existed (documented) |
| Structured blocks | Deliberate training practices (general) |
| Phase awareness | Fire-tending required phase monitoring |
| Non-interference | Silent, stationary activities required |

---

## Interpretation

Evidence is PARTIAL but supportive:

**SUPPORTED:**
- Apprentices had waiting periods during long processes
- Activities had to be non-interfering and quiet
- Writing practice was a standard apprentice skill
- Phase awareness was required

**NOT DIRECTLY DOCUMENTED:**
- Specific practice of grapheme writing during distillation
- Connection between waiting time and skill development

The HT interpretation remains PLAUSIBLE but cannot be elevated to STRONG_MATCH without direct documentation.
