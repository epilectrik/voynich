# Test 2: Forbidden Intervention Contexts

**Question:** When is intervention forbidden even if outcomes worsen?

**Verdict:** Three distinct prohibition types identified, structurally aligned with C490 (Categorical Strategy Exclusion).

---

## Methodology

Surveyed historical and modern sources to identify contexts where intervention is PROHIBITED (not merely inadvisable). Mapped to C490 structure (AGGRESSIVE strategy exclusion).

**Key distinction:**
- INADVISABLE = risky but possible
- FORBIDDEN = grammatically impossible

C490 shows that 20.5% of programs have **zero** AGGRESSIVE compatibility — intervention is not a gradient, it's a prohibition.

## Prohibition Types Identified

### Type 1: EQUILIBRIUM ESTABLISHMENT PROHIBITION

**Historical evidence:**
> "The process cannot be rushed and must be allowed to unfold naturally."
> "Patience and persistence... this stage is not a quick process."

**Modern parallel:**
- Reflux columns require time to reach steady-state
- Intervention during establishment disrupts equilibrium
- "Rushing" causes worse outcomes than waiting

**Structure:**
- Period of mandatory NON-INTERVENTION
- Even if intermediate states look wrong
- Intervention CAUSES failure, not prevents it
- Must trust the process

**C490 alignment:** Programs with high link density (>0.404) forbid AGGRESSIVE. High link density = complex dependencies = equilibrium-sensitive = intervention forbidden.

---

### Type 2: PHASE TRANSITION PROHIBITION

**Historical evidence:**
> "When the streaks begin to branch... then the spirits are gone."

**Structure:**
- During transition, the system is in unstable state
- Intervention during transition corrupts both phases
- Must WAIT until transition completes
- Judgment is "complete or not," intervention is binary

**Alchemical parallel:**
Brunschwig's "4th degree fire" — explicitly FORBIDDEN, not merely inadvisable. Some temperatures are categorically prohibited regardless of circumstance.

**C490 alignment:** This explains the CONSERVATIVE_WAITING archetype (17 folios, 0.000 AGGRESSIVE compatibility). Some programs REQUIRE waiting through transitions.

---

### Type 3: PURIFICATION CYCLE PROHIBITION

**Historical evidence:**
> "Repeated cycles of reflection, release, and refinement."
> "Just as physical distillation involves multiple stages of boiling and cooling."

**Modern parallel:**
> "Multiple passes required for separation efficiency."

**Structure:**
- Each cycle must complete before next begins
- Interrupting mid-cycle corrupts partial progress
- Cannot "speed up" by intervening
- Patience is not optional

**C490 alignment:** AGGRESSIVE strategies involve "fast throughput" — but some processes categorically exclude fast throughput as an option.

## Prohibition Structure Analysis

### Why Prohibitions Exist

| Prohibition Type | Physical Reason | Control Consequence |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Equilibrium | Complex dependencies | Intervention destabilizes |
| Phase transition | Unstable intermediate | Corruption of both phases |
| Purification cycle | Incremental refinement | Partial progress lost |

All three share a common structure:
> **Intervention during critical periods causes worse outcomes than inaction, even when inaction appears risky.**

This is the hallmark of **closed-loop process control** — the system has internal dynamics that must be allowed to operate.

---

## Connection to C490 (Categorical Strategy Exclusion)

C490 establishes:
- 17/83 folios (20.5%) have ZERO AGGRESSIVE compatibility
- All 17 are archetype CONSERVATIVE_WAITING
- Boundary: link_density > 0.404

**Interpretation:**
- High link density = many dependencies = many things can go wrong
- AGGRESSIVE = minimal intervention, fast throughput
- FORBIDDEN because: when dependencies are high, intervention risks cascade failure

The three prohibition types map to this:

| Prohibition Type | Why High Link Density |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Equilibrium | Many interdependent variables |
| Phase transition | State depends on many factors |
| Purification | Each stage depends on prior |

---

## The Judgment Load of Prohibition

**Key insight:** Knowing WHEN NOT TO ACT is itself a judgment.

| Judgment | Content |
|----------|---------|
| WATCH | Is this an equilibrium establishment period? |
| RECOGNIZE | Is this a phase transition? |
| TRUST | Is this a purification cycle? |
| RESTRAIN | Do NOT intervene |

This is **cognitively expensive** because:
- Natural instinct is to act when things look wrong
- Prohibition requires suppressing intervention impulse
- Trust in process requires experience

---

## HT Connection

C477 shows HT rises for difficult discrimination.

**Hypothesis:** HT may also rise in prohibition contexts:
- Not because discrimination is hard
- But because restraint is hard
- "Watch but do not touch" requires attention WITHOUT action

This is a distinct attention mode:
- Vigilance WITHOUT intervention
- Monitoring WITHOUT modification
- The operator must be PRESENT but PASSIVE

---

## Conclusion

**Test 2 Result: 3 PROHIBITION TYPES IDENTIFIED**

| Type | Context | Why Forbidden |
|------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | EQUILIBRIUM_ESTABLISHMENT | Intervention destabilizes |
| 2 | PHASE_TRANSITION | Corrupts both phases |
| 3 | PURIFICATION_CYCLE | Loses partial progress |

All three are:
- Categorically forbidden (not gradient)
- Structurally aligned with C490
- Judgment-intensive (knowing when NOT to act)

## Constraints Cited

- C490 - Categorical Strategy Exclusion
- C477 - HT Tail Correlation

---

## Historical Parallel

C490 already notes:
> "Matches Brunschwig's '4th degree fire' — explicitly FORBIDDEN, not merely inadvisable."

This test confirms the structural pattern extends beyond fire management to:
- Equilibrium establishment
- Phase transitions
- Purification cycles

The FORBIDDEN structure is general, not specific to temperature.
