# Test 1: "Watch Closely" Contexts

**Question:** When do historical distillation sources say to watch closely?

**Verdict:** Six distinct judgment classes identified, all requiring non-parametric human assessment.

---

## Methodology

Surveyed historical and modern distillation sources to identify contexts requiring heightened operator attention. Categorized findings by JUDGMENT TYPE, not judgment CONTENT.

**Sources:**
- Brunschwig's *Liber de arte distillandi* (via PMC academic analysis)
- Modern distillation troubleshooting literature
- Alchemical process descriptions

## Judgment Classes Identified

### Class 1: TEMPERATURE JUDGMENT (Non-Parametric)

**Historical evidence:**
> "The heat of a water bath should be checked regularly by touch, and must not get so hot that one cannot keep a finger in it."

**Structure:**
- No thermometer available
- Judgment is continuous (not threshold-based)
- Requires calibrated sensory baseline
- Cannot be encoded as a number

**HT correspondence:** This is a CONTINUOUS VIGILANCE context — attention must be sustained, not triggered.

---

### Class 2: PHASE TRANSITION JUDGMENT (Visual Signs)

**Historical evidence:**
> "When the streaks in the alembic begin to branch, and thick broad drops form in the helmet as if sweating internally, then the spirits are gone."

**Structure:**
- Operator must recognize PATTERN, not measure
- Signs are qualitative (branching, sweating)
- Timing is judgment-dependent
- Wrong phase = contamination or loss

**HT correspondence:** This is a CRITICAL WINDOW context — attention spikes at transition points.

---

### Class 3: QUALITY/PURITY JUDGMENT (Sensory Verification)

**Historical evidence:**
> "Taste distilled liquid to confirm spirit removal."
> "Cloudiness at the flask bottom, reddish tinting, or loss of taste and scent indicate approaching corruption."

**Structure:**
- No chemical assay available
- Operator IS the measurement instrument
- Judgment is comparative (to learned baseline)
- False positives safer than false negatives

**HT correspondence:** This is a VERIFICATION context — attention at quality checkpoints.

---

### Class 4: TIMING JUDGMENT (Process Completion)

**Historical evidence:**
> "Drops placed on a thumbnail that fail to run off suggest the water should be discarded."

**Modern parallel:**
> "Analyzing pressure and temperature profiles along the column height helps identify potential anomalies."

**Structure:**
- No absolute time specification
- Judgment depends on process state
- "Done" is recognized, not calculated
- Early/late both cause failure

**HT correspondence:** This is a TERMINATION context — attention at decision points.

---

### Class 5: MATERIAL STATE JUDGMENT (Viscosity/Flow)

**Historical evidence:**
- Drops that "run off" vs "fail to run off"
- Cloudiness, reddish tinting, thickness

**Modern parallel:**
- Flooding (liquid overwhelms column)
- Weeping (liquid leaks through perforations)
- Foaming (erratic flow patterns)

**Structure:**
- Material behavior is the indicator
- No direct measurement available
- Judgment is pattern-matching
- Requires experience with normal baseline

**HT correspondence:** This is a DEVIATION DETECTION context — attention when something is "off."

---

### Class 6: PROCESS STABILITY JUDGMENT (Normal vs Abnormal)

**Modern evidence:**
> "Operators should be vigilant for unusual noises or vibrations."
> "Regular monitoring of key performance indicators... can help identify potential issues early on."

**Structure:**
- "Normal" is learned, not specified
- Deviations require immediate attention
- Judgment is holistic (multiple signals)
- Cannot be parameterized

**HT correspondence:** This is a BACKGROUND VIGILANCE context — continuous low-level attention.

---

## Judgment Class Taxonomy

| Class | Trigger | Mode | HT Context |
|-------|---------|------|------------|
| TEMPERATURE | Continuous | Touch-based | Sustained vigilance |
| PHASE_TRANSITION | Event-based | Visual pattern | Critical window |
| QUALITY_PURITY | Checkpoint | Sensory comparison | Verification |
| TIMING | State-based | Behavioral | Termination decision |
| MATERIAL_STATE | Deviation | Pattern-matching | Deviation detection |
| STABILITY | Continuous | Holistic | Background vigilance |

---

## Common Structure Across Classes

All six judgment classes share:

1. **Non-parametric:** Cannot be encoded as numbers
2. **Comparative:** Require learned baseline
3. **Pattern-based:** Recognition, not measurement
4. **Experience-dependent:** Improve with practice
5. **Irreducible:** Cannot be automated or delegated

This is the structural signature of **judgment that must be supplied by a human operator**.

---

## Connection to C477 (HT Tail Correlation)

C477 shows HT rises when rare MIDDLEs appear (tail pressure).

**Interpretation:**
- Rare MIDDLEs may correspond to rare judgment contexts
- When unusual discrimination is required, attention must increase
- HT is a **vigilance signal** for non-routine judgment

This aligns with the judgment classes:
- Common situations → routine judgment → low HT
- Rare situations → heightened judgment → high HT

---

## Conclusion

**Test 1 Result: 6 JUDGMENT CLASSES IDENTIFIED**

| Class | Type | What Cannot Be Encoded |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| 1 | TEMPERATURE | Continuous thermal state |
| 2 | PHASE_TRANSITION | Visual pattern recognition |
| 3 | QUALITY_PURITY | Sensory quality assessment |
| 4 | TIMING | Process completion state |
| 5 | MATERIAL_STATE | Flow/behavior abnormality |
| 6 | STABILITY | Holistic normal vs abnormal |

All classes are:
- Structurally irreducible to parameters (C469 compliant)
- Attention-requiring (HT-aligned)
- Experience-dependent (apprenticeship knowledge)
