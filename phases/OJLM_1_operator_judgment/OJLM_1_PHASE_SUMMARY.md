# OJLM-1: Operator Judgment Load Mapping — Phase Summary

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Tier:** 3 (Exploratory, Non-Binding)
**Prerequisites:** PWRE-1 ✅, FM-PHY-1 ✅, SSD-PHY-1a ✅

## Executive Summary

The Voynich controller DELIBERATELY OMITS what cannot be encoded. Operator judgment is not a workaround — it is a **designed dependency** for 13 distinct judgment types that are structurally non-codifiable.

### Key Finding

| Test | Result | Count |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1. Watch Closely Contexts | 6 judgment classes | TEMPERATURE, PHASE_TRANSITION, QUALITY_PURITY, TIMING, MATERIAL_STATE, STABILITY |
| 2. Forbidden Intervention | 3 prohibition types | EQUILIBRIUM_ESTABLISHMENT, PHASE_TRANSITION, PURIFICATION_CYCLE |
| 3. Experience vs Instruction | 4 tacit knowledge types | SENSORY_CALIBRATION, EQUIPMENT_FEEL, TIMING_INTUITION, TROUBLE_RECOGNITION |

**Total: 13 distinct judgment types** that must be supplied by human operators.

**Conclusion:** The controller's omissions are not gaps — they are structural acknowledgment that some knowledge cannot be encoded.

## Test Results

### Test 1: "Watch Closely" Contexts

**Question:** When do historical sources say to watch closely?

**Answer:** 6 distinct judgment classes requiring non-parametric human assessment.

| Class | Type | What Cannot Be Encoded |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| 1 | TEMPERATURE | Continuous thermal state (touch-based) |
| 2 | PHASE_TRANSITION | Visual pattern recognition |
| 3 | QUALITY_PURITY | Sensory quality assessment |
| 4 | TIMING | Process completion state |
| 5 | MATERIAL_STATE | Flow/behavior abnormality |
| 6 | STABILITY | Holistic normal vs abnormal |

All classes are:
- Non-parametric (cannot be numbers)
- Comparative (require learned baseline)
- Pattern-based (recognition, not measurement)

### Test 2: Forbidden Intervention Contexts

**Question:** When is intervention forbidden even if outcomes worsen?

**Answer:** 3 prohibition types structurally aligned with C490.

| Type | Context | Why Forbidden |
|------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | EQUILIBRIUM_ESTABLISHMENT | Intervention destabilizes complex dependencies |
| 2 | PHASE_TRANSITION | Corrupts both phases during unstable state |
| 3 | PURIFICATION_CYCLE | Loses partial progress from incomplete cycle |

C490 alignment confirmed:
- 20.5% of programs have ZERO AGGRESSIVE compatibility
- All are archetype CONSERVATIVE_WAITING
- Prohibition is categorical, not gradient

### Test 3: Experience vs Instruction Boundary

**Question:** When does experience trump written instruction?

**Answer:** 4 tacit knowledge types that CANNOT be transmitted through writing.

| Type | What Must Be Learned | Why Non-Codifiable |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | SENSORY_CALIBRATION | Identity-dependent baseline |
| 2 | EQUIPMENT_FEEL | Instance-specific behavior |
| 3 | TIMING_INTUITION | Holistic integration |
| 4 | TROUBLE_RECOGNITION | Deviation from implicit model |

Key insight from tacit knowledge research:
> "We can know more than we can tell." — Polanyi

The controller DELIBERATELY OMITS what falls on the "cannot tell" side of this boundary.

## Success Criteria Assessment

| Criterion | Threshold | Result |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Judgment classes identified | ≥ 5 | **13 IDENTIFIED** |
| HT correspondence tested | At least 3 | **6 classes aligned** |
| C490 alignment verified | Forbidden contexts match | **CONFIRMED** |
| No semantic drift | Confirmed | **CONFIRMED** |

**Phase Status: SUCCESS (all criteria met)**

---

## What This Phase Established

### 1. Judgment Is Designed Into the System

The controller's omissions are not failures or limitations — they are **deliberate acknowledgment** that:
- Some knowledge cannot be encoded (C469)
- Some attention must be human-supplied (C477)
- Some interventions must be forbidden (C490)

### 2. The 13 Judgment Types Are Structurally Distinct

| Category | Types | Common Property |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Watch Closely | 6 | Require continuous/event attention |
| Forbidden Intervention | 3 | Require restraint, not action |
| Tacit Knowledge | 4 | Require experience, not instruction |

These are not arbitrary categories — they reflect **structural boundaries** of what can be encoded.

### 3. HT Aligns With Judgment Load

C477 shows HT rises when rare MIDDLEs appear.

This phase explains WHY:
- Rare situations require judgment classes that are harder
- Common situations have well-practiced judgment
- HT signals "this requires experience, not just routine"

### 4. The Controller Acknowledges Its Own Limits

The system does NOT try to encode everything. Instead:
- It encodes what CAN be encoded (categorical resolution)
- It gates what IS/ISN'T legal (AGGRESSIVE prohibition)
- It signals when attention is needed (HT)
- It TRUSTS the operator to supply the rest

This is **design integrity**, not incompleteness.

## Connection to Prior Work

| Prior Finding | OJLM-1 Extension |
|---------------|------------------|
| PWRE-1: Irrecoverability architecture | Explains WHY: recovery requires judgment |
| FM-PHY-1: Hazard distribution diagnostic | Explains WHERE: hazards require vigilance |
| SSD-PHY-1a: Physics-forced dimensionality | Explains WHAT: distinctions require experience |
| C469: Categorical resolution only | Explains HOW: non-parametric = judgment-dependent |
| C477: HT tail correlation | Explains WHEN: rare = harder judgment |
| C490: AGGRESSIVE prohibition | Explains WHY NOT: some contexts forbid action |

## The Complete Arc

The four post-PWRE-1 phases now form a coherent explanation:

| Phase | Question | Answer |
|-------|----------|--------|
| PWRE-1 | What plant? | Circulatory thermal |
| FM-PHY-1 | Why that hazard profile? | Natural failure distribution |
| SSD-PHY-1a | Why so many distinctions? | Physics-forced discrimination |
| **OJLM-1** | **What must humans supply?** | **13 judgment types** |

Together:
> The Voynich Manuscript is a controller for a circulatory thermal plant whose hazard profile matches distillation physics, whose discrimination space is forced by the physical state-space, and whose operation REQUIRES human judgment for 13 structurally distinct types of non-codifiable knowledge.

## Promotion Assessment

### Could Anything Be Promoted?

The judgment classes are **structural categories**, not semantic content:
- We know WHAT KINDS of judgment exist
- We do NOT know what those judgments ARE ABOUT

**Recommendation:** No Tier-2 promotion. Findings remain Tier 3 (exploratory, non-binding) as structural characterization without semantic content.

## Files Generated

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `phase_specification.md` | Pre-registration |
| `watch_closely_contexts.md` | Test 1 results |
| `forbidden_intervention.md` | Test 2 results |
| `experience_instruction_boundary.md` | Test 3 results |
| `OJLM_1_PHASE_SUMMARY.md` | This summary |

## Recommended Follow-Up

1. **Expert review** — Validate judgment class taxonomy against process engineering literature
2. **Quantitative HT mapping** — Test whether specific judgment classes correlate with HT patterns
3. **Cross-validation** — Compare judgment taxonomy to other pre-instrumental craft knowledge systems
4. **Consolidation** — Consider whether findings warrant publication framing

## Epistemic Safety Clause

> *This phase does not decode the Voynich Manuscript. It uses physics and historical operator knowledge to identify structural classes of irreducible human judgment. All findings are Tier 3 unless they establish logical necessity. No semantic content is assigned to judgment classes.*
