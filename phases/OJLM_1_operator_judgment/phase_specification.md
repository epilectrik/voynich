# Phase: OJLM-1 (Operator Judgment Load Mapping)

## Pre-Registration

- **Date:** 2026-01-13
- **Tier:** 3 (Exploratory, Non-Binding)
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Prerequisites:** PWRE-1 ✅, FM-PHY-1 ✅, SSD-PHY-1a ✅

---

## Purpose

Test what kinds of physical judgments are **irreducible to parameters** and must be supplied by human operators in circulatory thermal processes.

**Core Question:**
> What kinds of distinctions must a human recognize, even though the system refuses to encode them?

This is now legitimate because:
- C469 proves the system doesn't encode parameters (categorical only)
- C477 proves HT tracks judgment load (attention spikes for rare MIDDLEs)
- SSD-PHY-1a proves complexity is plant-imposed (not notation choice)

---

## Why This Phase Is Now Legitimate

PWRE-1 + FM-PHY-1 + SSD-PHY-1a established:
1. The plant class is circulatory thermal (distillation/reflux)
2. The hazard distribution is diagnostic for this class
3. The discrimination space is physics-forced, not mnemonic

This implies:
- Judgment is a **designed dependency**
- The controller is **intentionally under-informative**
- Operator expertise must **fill gaps the system deliberately leaves**

OJLM-1 asks: **What are those gaps?**

## Absolute Prohibitions (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Claude **MUST NOT**:
- Name specific substances, materials, or products
- Identify what the operator is judging (only WHAT KIND of judgment)
- Assign semantic content to judgment classes
- Map HT to specific physical conditions
- Propose what operators "see" or "smell" or "feel"

This phase studies **judgment structure**, not judgment content.

---

## Allowed Frame

Claude **MAY**:
- Survey historical operator instruction texts for judgment CLASS patterns
- Identify structural categories of irreducible judgment
- Map judgment classes to HT density patterns
- Use irrecoverability architecture as a constraint
- Compare to C490 (AGGRESSIVE prohibition) for forbidden intervention contexts

---

## Test 1: "Watch Closely" Contexts

### Question
When do historical distillation sources say to watch closely?

### Methodology
- Survey early modern distillation texts (Brunschwig, etc.)
- Identify contexts requiring heightened attention
- Categorize by judgment TYPE, not judgment CONTENT
- Map to HT density patterns where possible

### What We Are NOT Doing
- Identifying what operators watched FOR
- Naming visual, olfactory, or tactile cues
- Decoding what HT "means"

### Success Criteria
- At least 3 "watch closely" context types identified
- Structural categorization (not semantic)

---

## Test 2: Forbidden Intervention Contexts

### Question
When is intervention forbidden even if outcomes worsen?

### Methodology
- Survey historical sources for "do not touch" warnings
- Identify contexts where intervention is prohibited
- Map to AGGRESSIVE prohibition (C490) structure
- Categorize by intervention TYPE, not content

### Success Criteria
- At least 2 forbidden intervention context types identified
- Structural alignment with C490

---

## Test 3: Experience vs Instruction Boundary

### Question
When does experience trump written instruction?

### Methodology
- Survey historical sources for "apprenticeship knowledge" boundaries
- Identify what the controller deliberately omits
- Map to irrecoverability architecture
- Categorize by knowledge TYPE, not content

### Success Criteria
- At least 3 experience-only knowledge types identified
- Structural alignment with irrecoverability

---

## Required Constraint Inputs

- C469 - Categorical Resolution Principle
- C477 - HT Tail Correlation
- C490 - AGGRESSIVE prohibition (if exists)
- Irrecoverability architecture from PWRE-1

## Epistemic Safety Clause

> *This phase does not decode the Voynich Manuscript. It uses physics and historical operator knowledge to identify structural classes of irreducible human judgment. All findings are Tier 3 unless they establish logical necessity. No semantic content is assigned to judgment classes.*
