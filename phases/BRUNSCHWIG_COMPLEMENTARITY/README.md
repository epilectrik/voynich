# Phase: BRUNSCHWIG_COMPLEMENTARITY

## Status: COMPLETE

## Original Question (INVALID)

> Do Brunschwig recipes show complementary handling-role composition that matches Voynich jar triplet enrichment?

**Result:** STRUCTURALLY INAPPLICABLE

Brunschwig describes SIMPLES (single-material waters), not compound recipes.
Voynich jars describe JOINT PROCESSING (multi-material working sets).
These are different representational layers - test cannot be run as designed.

## Revised Question (VALID)

> Does Brunschwig warn verbally where Voynich forbids grammatically?

**Result:** ORTHOGONAL ALIGNMENT (weak positive)

## Findings

### Warning Space Comparison

| Axis | Voynich | Brunschwig |
|------|---------|------------|
| PHASE_ORDERING | 41% (dominant) | LOW |
| COMPOSITION_JUMP | 24% | MODERATE |
| ENERGY/HEAT | 6% | HIGH (dominant) |
| TOXIC MATERIALS | N/A | HIGH (gifft=48) |

### Interpretation

The warning spaces are COMPLEMENTARY, not overlapping:
- **Brunschwig focus:** WHAT (materials, heat levels, internal vs external)
- **Voynich focus:** WHEN (sequence, transitions, phase ordering)

This is consistent with the model prediction:
> "Voynich internalizes what Brunschwig externalizes"

### Strength

WEAK POSITIVE - no direct overlap, but orthogonal division of labor is consistent with apparatus-centric model.

## Files

- `test_specification.md` - Original (invalid) test design
- `exclusion_test_results.json` - Negative-space test results

## Closure

Brunschwig correlation work is COMPLETE. Further testing would:
- Require semantic forcing (violates C171)
- Manufacture artifacts
- Not add signal

The texts do different jobs. Orthogonality is the expected relationship.
