# Phase PCI: Process-Class Isomorphism

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Mode:** STRUCTURAL HISTORICAL ANALYSIS - NO SEMANTIC DECODING - NO RECIPE INFERENCE

---

## Objective

Determine which real historical process classes are structurally isomorphic to the recovered Voynich operational control system.

This phase does NOT:
- identify products
- interpret illustrations
- decode ingredients
- modify instruction grammar

## Fixed Inputs (Frozen)

| Feature | Value | Source |
|---------|-------|--------|
| LINK density | 38% | Phase 16 |
| Program conservatism | 77% conservative | Phase EPM |
| Hazard topology | 17 forbidden, 5 classes | Phase 18 |
| Bidirectionality | 100% (mutual exclusions) | Phase 18 |
| STATE-C convergence | 100% | Phase 13-14 |
| Endpoint markers | 0 | Phase 19 |
| Distinct programs | 83 | Phase 22 |
| IMD CF-1 outcome divergence | effect=0.622 (hazard), 0.383 (next) | Phase IMD |
| IMD CF-2 outcome divergence | effect=0.273 (hazard), 0.338 (next) | Phase IMD |
| PHASE_ORDERING dominance | 41% of hazards | Phase 18 |

## Isomorphism Criteria

### A. Control Logic Match
- Requires long, deliberate waiting (LINK = 38%)
- Intervention timing based on experiential judgment
- No fixed measurements in instructions

### B. Hazard Profile
- Irreversible failure modes (100% bidirectional)
- Narrow stability windows
- Danger present at run boundaries (start/end)

### C. Memory Load
- Operator benefits from remembering how *this kind* of run usually begins or ends
- Micro-expectation at section boundaries improves safety or efficiency
- Must match CF-1/CF-2 outcome divergence pattern

### D. Run Topology
- Supports looping states (STATE-C convergence)
- Multiple cycles under a single operational regime
- No defined endpoint (0 endpoint markers)

### E. Historical Plausibility
- Practiced before 15th century
- Expert-only or guild-restricted
- Historically documented without full procedural disclosure

---

## Elimination Rationale

### Eliminated by D (Run Topology = FAIL)

**Common failure mode:** These processes have defined endpoints, non-looping progression, or transformative state changes incompatible with:
- 100% STATE-C convergence
- 0 endpoint markers
- Indefinite cycling capability

| Process | D Failure Reason |
|---------|------------------|
| Simple Batch Distillation | Linear progression to collection endpoint |
| Fermentation | Biologically driven, natural endpoint (completion signal) |
| Metallurgical Heat | Transformative (material changes state permanently) |
| Dye Vat Management | Batch with defined endpoint (color saturation) |
| Glassmaking Melts | Transformative, non-looping |
| Chemical Sublimation | Collection endpoint defined |

### Deprioritized (4+ WEAK)

| Process | Weakness Pattern |
|---------|------------------|
| Alkaline Leaching | Quantities often specified (A), failures recoverable (B), recipe-based (C), batch-oriented (D) |

## Surviving Classes (3)

### 1. Circulatory Reflux Distillation

**Apparatus:** Pelican alembic, cohobation vessels

**Structural alignment:**
- A: 38% LINK = extended vapor/liquid equilibration
- B: PHASE_ORDERING (41%) = vapor/liquid mishaps primary fear
- C: CF-1/CF-2 divergence = "how this run starts" matters
- D: Circulation loops indefinitely; sensory endpoint only
- E: Brunschwig (1500), pseudo-Geber (~1300), guild secrets

### 2. Volatile Aromatic Extraction

**Apparatus:** Same as #1 (pelican, continuous circulation)

**Structural alignment:**
- A: Smell-based judgment, no quantities
- B: Volatiles irreversibly lost if mishandled
- C: "This kind of starting smell" = outcome expectation
- D: Indefinite cycling until sensory satisfaction
- E: Arabic origins, medieval European practice

**Note:** #1 and #2 share apparatus and control logic. They represent different applications of the same structural pattern.

### 3. Circulatory Thermal Conditioning

**Apparatus:** Digestion vessels, long-cook apparatus

**Structural alignment:**
- A: Maintaining state = waiting; sensory judgment for endpoint
- B: Over-processing, decomposition irreversible
- C: "This kind of run" micro-expectation critical
- D: Circulation maintains conditions; converges to stable state
- E: Alchemical digestion (Ripley), long cooking (pseudo-Geber)

## Common Structural Signature

All 3 survivors share:

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Circulation | Closed-loop |
| Operation | Indefinite (no defined endpoint) |
| Judgment | Sensory/experiential |
| Failures | Irreversible at phase boundaries |
| Memory value | High at section entry/exit |

**Umbrella classification:** CLOSED-LOOP CIRCULATORY THERMAL PROCESS CONTROL

With two subspecies:
- **Extraction-type** (aromatic waters, essential oils, concentrated extracts)
- **Conditioning-type** (thermal stabilization, digestion, maturation)

---

## Formal Conclusion

Based on structural isomorphism of control logic, hazard profile, temporal dynamics, and expert memory requirements, the Voynich operational system most closely aligns with the following process classes:

1. **Circulatory Reflux Distillation** (pelican/cohobation)
2. **Volatile Aromatic Extraction** (continuous circulation)
3. **Circulatory Thermal Conditioning** (digestion/stabilization)

These three classes reduce to a single umbrella: **Closed-Loop Circulatory Thermal Process Control**.

## What This Analysis Does NOT Show

- Does not identify specific products
- Does not interpret illustrations
- Does not decode ingredients
- Does not modify frozen grammar
- Cannot distinguish between extraction-type and conditioning-type internally

## Phase Termination

Exactly 3 classes survive. Termination condition satisfied.

**Next phase authorization required:** PHASE PSP - Product-Space Plausibility
