## Axis Definitions

| Axis | Question | What Score 3 Means |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **A1: Process Compatibility** | Requires closed-loop circulation, benefits from long conditioning, penalized by phase change? | Perfect match to locked grammar constraints |
| **A2: Control Complexity Justification** | Would failure be costly enough to justify 49 instruction classes and 17 forbidden transitions? | High stakes, degradation-prone, expert control historically attested |
| **A3: Material Class Compatibility** | Aligns with CLASS_A/B/D/E; uses phase-stable carriers; substrate variability expected? | Perfect match to material compatibility findings |
| **A4: Economic & Social Value (1400-1450)** | High value per unit, trade relevance, guild protection likely? | Major trade commodity, guild-protected |
| **A5: Frequency of Production** | Repeated making justifies program library vs. oral transmission? | Regular production, 83 programs plausibly needed |
| **A6: Outcome Judgment Externality** | Quality judged by senses, "done" subjective, no instrumental endpoints? | Pure sensory judgment, no objective completion criterion |
| **A7: Historical Documentation Pattern** | Semi-secret transmission, rarely written explicitly, known by practice? | Perfect match to manuscript's non-semantic design |

## Candidate Products Evaluated

### 1. AROMATIC WATERS (Rose, Lavender, Floral)

| Axis | Score | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| A1: Process | **3** | Pelican alembic circulation ideal; volatiles need equilibration; phase change (distillation-to-dryness) fatal to quality |
| A2: Control | **2** | Volatiles lost if overheated; off-notes develop; quality varies with handling—but not life-threatening failure |
| A3: Material | **3** | Dried flowers/petals = CLASS_A; water/alcohol carriers = CLASS_D/E; seasonal/regional substrate variation expected |
| A4: Economic | **3** | Rose water = major luxury trade commodity; perfumers' guilds documented; high value per unit |
| A5: Frequency | **3** | Seasonal production, regular batches; different flowers/intensities justify 83 programs |
| A6: Outcome | **3** | Fragrance quality assessed by nose; clarity by eye; "done" = operator judgment of scent profile |
| A7: Documentation | **2** | Formulas guarded but Brunschwig publishes some; guild apprenticeship essential |
| **TOTAL** | **19/21** | |

**Fatal Failures**: None

**Residual Tension**: Why 83 programs for ~10-20 aromatic types? (Resolved by substrate × intensity interpretation)

---

### 2. MEDICINAL HERB INFUSIONS/WATERS

| Axis | Score | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| A1: Process | **3** | Circulation extracts compounds; extended extraction needed for roots/bark; phase change degrades therapeutics |
| A2: Control | **3** | Medicines must not be toxic; therapeutic compounds can break down; apothecary training required |
| A3: Material | **3** | Dried herbs = CLASS_A; wine/water/alcohol carriers = CLASS_D/E; many herbs, conditions, sources |
| A4: Economic | **3** | Medicine always valuable; apothecary guilds powerful; high social stakes |
| A5: Frequency | **2** | Medicines needed regularly, but 83 programs seems excessive for herbal waters alone |
| A6: Outcome | **2** | Taste/color/smell guide judgment, but potency assessment harder without patient testing |
| A7: Documentation | **2** | Antidotaria published but with gaps; strong apprenticeship tradition |
| **TOTAL** | **18/21** | |

**Fatal Failures**: None

**Residual Tension**: Why no dosage or ingredient lists if medicinal? (Tension with "pure operational" verdict)

---

### 3. RESIN EXTRACTS (Frankincense, Myrrh, Mastic)

| Axis | Score | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| A1: Process | **3** | Circulation extracts from dense material; resins need long conditioning; solidification = failure |
| A2: Control | **2** | Resins expensive but failure not catastrophic; can burn or solidify if mishandled |
| A3: Material | **3** | Matches CLASS_B perfectly (hydrophobic, dense, slow diffusion); alcohol carriers required |
| A4: Economic | **2** | Incense/varnish/medicine valuable; Levantine trade important; but specialty market |
| A5: Frequency | **1** | Fewer resin types than aromatics; less frequent production; 83 programs excessive |
| A6: Outcome | **3** | Clarity, smell, consistency judged by senses; "done" = subjective quality assessment |
| A7: Documentation | **2** | Alchemical tradition semi-secret; practice-based transmission |
| **TOTAL** | **16/21** | |

**Fatal Failures**: None

**Residual Tension**: 83 programs far exceeds number of resin types

---

### 4. COSMETIC PREPARATIONS

| Axis | Score | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| A1: Process | **1** | Many cosmetics involve creams/emulsions (CLASS_C = 19.8% failure); not all circulation-based |
| A2: Control | **1** | Quality matters but failure not dangerous; less critical than medicine |
| A3: Material | **1** | Fats, oils, emulsions = CLASS_C incompatibility; grammar explicitly fails on these |
| A4: Economic | **2** | Luxury cosmetics high-value; but production methods don't match grammar |
| A5: Frequency | **2** | Regular production; but process mismatch more important |
| A6: Outcome | **3** | Pure sensory judgment (appearance, texture, scent) |
| A7: Documentation | **2** | Semi-secret luxury formulas; apprenticeship |
| **TOTAL** | **12/21** | |

**Fatal Failures**: Near-fatal CLASS_C tension (A3 = 1)

**Verdict**: Unlikely primary product due to emulsion/fat incompatibility

---

### 5. FOOD FLAVORING ESSENCES

| Axis | Score | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| A1: Process | **2** | Flavor extraction fits; but concentration often requires evaporation (phase change tension) |
| A2: Control | **1** | Off-flavors possible but not dangerous; lower stakes than medicine or perfume |
| A3: Material | **2** | Herbs/spices = CLASS_A; but some concentration methods = CLASS_C problems |
| A4: Economic | **2** | Spices valuable but essences less traded as distinct commodity |
| A5: Frequency | **2** | Regular kitchen/professional use |
| A6: Outcome | **3** | Pure taste judgment; "done" = flavor profile acceptable |
| A7: Documentation | **1** | Less secret than perfumery; more orally transmitted |
| **TOTAL** | **13/21** | |

**Fatal Failures**: None, but weak overall

**Verdict**: Possible secondary use but doesn't justify grammar complexity

---

### 6. RITUAL/RELIGIOUS SUBSTANCES

| Axis | Score | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| A1: Process | **2** | Depends on specific substance; incense oils would fit |
| A2: Control | **2** | Sacred substances require care; symbolic importance high |
| A3: Material | **2** | Variable—some fit, some don't |
| A4: Economic | **2** | Church patronage high-value; but limited commercial trade |
| A5: Frequency | **1** | Seasonal/ritual production; less frequent than commercial |
| A6: Outcome | **2** | Sensory plus symbolic criteria |
| A7: Documentation | **3** | HIGHLY secret transmission; perfect non-documentation fit |
| **TOTAL** | **14/21** | |

**Fatal Failures**: None

**Residual Tension**: Would a single workshop have 83 ritual substance programs?

---

### 7. INDUSTRIAL SOLVENTS/CLEANERS

| Axis | Score | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| A1: Process | **1** | Some circulation possible; but why complexity? |
| A2: Control | **0** | **FATAL** — Solvents are forgiving; no justification for 17 forbidden transitions |
| A3: Material | **1** | Limited substrate range |
| A4: Economic | **1** | Low value per unit; bulk commodity |
| A5: Frequency | **1** | High frequency but simple processes |
| A6: Outcome | **1** | Objective success criteria (does it clean/dissolve?) |
| A7: Documentation | **0** | Not secret; openly traded |
| **TOTAL** | **5/21** | |

**Fatal Failures**: A2 = 0 (no control complexity justification)

**Verdict**: ELIMINATED — Cannot justify grammar complexity

---

### 8. FERMENTED PRODUCTS (Wine, Beer, Vinegar)

| Axis | Score | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| A1: Process | **0** | **FATAL** — Fermentation is batch, not continuous; involves biological phase changes |
| A2: Control | — | N/A due to fatal |
| A3: Material | — | N/A |
| A4: Economic | — | N/A |
| A5: Frequency | — | N/A |
| A6: Outcome | — | N/A |
| A7: Documentation | — | N/A |
| **TOTAL** | **ELIMINATED** | |

**Fatal Failures**: A1 = 0 (batch process with biological phase change)

**Verdict**: ELIMINATED — Fundamental process incompatibility

---

### 9. DISTILLED SPIRITS (Aqua Vitae, Brandy)

| Axis | Score | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| A1: Process | **0** | **FATAL** — Requires vapor→liquid phase change; CLASS_C = 100% PHASE_COLLAPSE |
| A2: Control | — | N/A due to fatal |
| A3: Material | — | N/A |
| A4: Economic | — | N/A |
| A5: Frequency | — | N/A |
| A6: Outcome | — | N/A |
| A7: Documentation | — | N/A |
| **TOTAL** | **ELIMINATED** | |

**Fatal Failures**: A1 = 0 (requires phase change)

**Verdict**: ELIMINATED — Grammar explicitly fails on phase-change processes

---

### 10. PHARMACEUTICAL CONCENTRATES

| Axis | Score | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| A1: Process | **1** | Concentration typically requires evaporation (phase change); tension with CLASS_C |
| A2: Control | **3** | Medical stakes justify complexity; degradation = harm |
| A3: Material | **1** | Plant matter = CLASS_A, but concentration step = CLASS_C problems |
| A4: Economic | **3** | Extremely high value; guild protection; physician patronage |
| A5: Frequency | **2** | Regular pharmaceutical production |
| A6: Outcome | **2** | Sensory judgment plus efficacy testing |
| A7: Documentation | **2** | Semi-secret pharmaceutical knowledge |
| **TOTAL** | **14/21** | |

**Fatal Failures**: Near-fatal concentration/phase-change tension

**Verdict**: Possible for non-concentrated preparations only
