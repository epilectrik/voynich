## Second Pass: Why This Book?

The scoring analysis identified **Aromatic Waters** and **Medicinal Herb Waters** as top candidates. But convergence scores alone don't explain *why* someone would create a book like this.

This section asks: What about these products would motivate:
- A **non-semantic executable grammar**?
- **Illustrations without labels**?
- **No endpoints encoded**?
- **83 distinct programs**?

---

## TOP CANDIDATE #1: AROMATIC WATERS

### Why a Non-Semantic Executable Grammar?

**The Problem Aromatic Water Production Faces**:

| Challenge | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Volatiles escape easily** | Overheating = fragrance loss |
| **Quality varies unpredictably** | Same rose, different batches, different outcomes |
| **Phase boundaries destroy product** | Distilling-to-dryness = burned notes |
| **Skill is tacit, not verbal** | "You know when it's right" |
| **Regional/seasonal variation** | Persian roses ≠ Provençal roses |

**Why Words Don't Help**:

An aromatic water maker doesn't need to be told "this is rose water." They *know* what they're making. What they need is:
- How hard to push this particular batch
- When to wait and when to adjust
- What danger signs to avoid
- How to recover if things drift

**This is exactly what an operational grammar provides.**

The book encodes *how to operate*, not *what to make*—because the operator already knows what they're making.

### Why Illustrations Without Labels?

**Category, Not Species**:

Aromatic water production involves dozens of plant sources:
- Rosa damascena, R. centifolia, R. gallica...
- Lavandula angustifolia, L. latifolia, L. stoechas...
- Citrus aurantium, C. sinensis, C. bergamia...

But the processing **doesn't depend on species**. It depends on:
- Is this material porous or dense?
- Is it delicate or robust?
- Does it release quickly or slowly?

**The abstract plant illustrations function as category markers**:
- "Flowery plant with delicate structure" = use gentle programs
- "Root-heavy plant" = use extended programs
- "Dense resinous material" = use aggressive programs

Labels would be *wrong* because the operator's local plants may differ from the illustrator's.

### Why No Endpoints Encoded?

**Fragrance Has No Objective Measure**:

When is rose water "done"? When it:
- Smells right (operator's judgment)
- Looks right (clarity, color)
- Feels right (viscosity, mouthfeel for culinary use)

There is no thermometer, no weight, no volume that defines completion. The operator's sensory judgment is the endpoint.

**The grammar can't encode "done" because "done" is subjective.**

The book tells you how to run the apparatus safely toward a target state. The operator decides when that state has arrived.

### Why 83 Programs?

**Substrate × Intensity Matrix**:

| Dimension | Variations |
|-----------|-----------|
| Plant source | ~15-20 major types |
| Plant part (flower, root, peel, seed) | 4-5 |
| Material condition (fresh-dried, aged, regional) | 3-4 |
| Intensity level (light, standard, concentrated) | 3-4 |

Combinatorics: 20 × 4 × 3 × 3 = 720 theoretical combinations

But most are unused. A working library of **60-100 programs** is reasonable for:
- Each major aromatic type
- Each intensity level appropriate to that type
- Each problematic substrate variation encountered over years

**83 programs = a mature workshop's accumulated expertise.**

## TOP CANDIDATE #2: MEDICINAL HERB WATERS

### Why a Non-Semantic Executable Grammar?

**The Problem Medicinal Water Production Faces**:

| Challenge | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Therapeutic compounds degrade** | Overheating = loss of potency |
| **Toxicity from mishandling** | Some herbs become dangerous |
| **Quality not visually obvious** | Can't see if medicine works |
| **Stakes are high** | Patient harm from failed preparation |
| **Skill transmitted through apprenticeship** | Written recipes are incomplete |

**Why Words Don't Help**:

An apothecary doesn't need "this is chamomile water." They need:
- How to extract without destroying therapeutics
- Which herbs need gentle handling
- Which can be pushed harder
- How to maintain potency during extended processing

**Why This Fits the Grammar**:

The 17 forbidden transitions become **safety constraints**. You cannot:
- Skip thermal stabilization before material addition
- Push a delicate herb with aggressive circulation
- Combine incompatible extraction phases

The AGGRESSIVE programs handle tough roots and bark. The CONSERVATIVE programs handle delicate flowers. The forbidden transitions prevent dangerous combinations.

### Why Illustrations Without Labels?

**Same Reason as Aromatics**:

The apothecary knows their herbs. The illustrations mark:
- This section = soft leaf materials
- This section = hard root materials
- This section = aromatic flowers

The operator matches their herb to the appropriate section.

### Why No Endpoints Encoded?

**Potency Has No Instrumental Measure (in 1400)**:

How do you know chamomile water is potent enough?
- Taste (bitterness, flavor intensity)
- Color (depth, clarity)
- Smell (aromatic strength)
- Experience (this batch feels right)

There were no assays, no chromatography, no lab tests. The operator's trained judgment was the only endpoint.

### Why 83 Programs?

**Herb Diversity × Handling Requirements**:

Medieval materia medica included hundreds of herbs. A working apothecary might use:
- 30-50 primary herbs regularly
- 2-3 handling intensities per herb type
- Several substrate conditions (fresh-dried, old, regional variants)

**83 programs = coverage of a professional herbal practice.**

### Residual Tension

**Why No Dosage Information?**

Medicinal preparations typically specify amounts. The complete absence of dosage/quantity information is in tension with medicinal purpose.

**Possible Resolution**: This is an *apparatus operation* manual, not a *recipe* book. Dosage is determined:
- By the physician prescribing
- By the apothecary's experience
- External to this book entirely

The book tells you how to run the apparatus. What goes in and how much comes out is operator knowledge.

## VIABLE SUBSET: RESIN EXTRACTS

### Why This Fits (as Subset, Not Primary)

Resin extraction explains the AGGRESSIVE programs that don't fit aromatics or medicinals well.

| Resin Challenge | Grammar Solution |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Dense, hydrophobic material | AGGRESSIVE programs (18% of library) |
| Long extraction time | EXTENDED scale programs |
| Solidification risk | PHASE_COLLAPSE hazard class |
| Needs pushing | Low-LINK programs |

### Why Not Primary?

- Too few resin types for 83 programs
- Economic scale smaller than aromatics
- Doesn't explain CONSERVATIVE program dominance (77%)

**Best Interpretation**: A workshop producing primarily aromatic/medicinal waters *also* processed resins occasionally, using the AGGRESSIVE program subset.

---

## Synthesis: The Multi-Product Workshop

The grammar best fits a **multi-product aromatic workshop**:

| Product | Programs Used | Frequency |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Aromatic waters | CONSERVATIVE, MODERATE | High (primary) |
| Medicinal waters | MODERATE | High (secondary) |
| Resin extracts | AGGRESSIVE | Occasional |
| Stabilization/finishing | ULTRA_CONSERVATIVE | As needed |

**The book is not a recipe collection. It is an apparatus operation manual.**

The operator knows:
- What product they're making (oral tradition, training)
- What material they're using (observation, experience)
- What quality they're targeting (sensory judgment)

The book tells them:
- Which program to select for this material
- How to run the apparatus safely
- What danger signs to avoid
- How to recover if things drift

## Intent Analysis Summary

| Question | Aromatic Waters Answer | Medicinal Waters Answer |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Why non-semantic grammar? | Words don't help with tacit skill | Words don't help with tacit skill |
| Why illustrations without labels? | Category markers, not species IDs | Category markers, not species IDs |
| Why no endpoints? | Fragrance is subjective | Potency is subjective (1400) |
| Why 83 programs? | Substrate × intensity matrix | Herb diversity × handling |
| What motivated creating this book? | Valuable tacit knowledge worth preserving | Valuable tacit knowledge worth preserving |

**Both candidates resolve all design questions similarly.**

The 1-point difference in scoring reflects:
- Aromatic waters: Better frequency justification (83 programs)
- Medicinal waters: Higher control stakes (17 forbidden transitions)

---

## The Decisive Difference

**Aromatic Waters** explains one thing Medicinal Waters doesn't:

**Why the book doesn't identify what's being made.**

For aromatics:
- The operator smells what they're making
- The material is obvious (rose petals, lavender flowers)
- The product announces itself to the senses

For medicine:
- The operator might need to know which herb
- Therapeutic differences between similar plants
- Higher stakes for misidentification

The **complete absence of material identification** fits aromatic production better, where sensory cues are unambiguous.

---

## What Still Bothers Us

Even with Aromatic Waters as the strongest candidate, residual tensions remain:

| Tension | Concern | Severity |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **17 forbidden transitions** | Seems excessive for aromatics | MODERATE |
| **3 RESTART programs** | Why need to restart aromatic production? | LOW |
| **f57r = RESTART_PROTOCOL** | What catastrophe requires full reset? | LOW |
| **18% AGGRESSIVE programs** | Higher than expected for delicate florals | LOW-MODERATE |

**Possible Resolution**: The workshop processed a **broader range of materials** than pure aromatics:
- Some medicinal waters (higher stakes → forbidden transitions)
- Some resin extracts (dense materials → AGGRESSIVE programs)
- Occasional failures requiring restart (contamination, accidents)
