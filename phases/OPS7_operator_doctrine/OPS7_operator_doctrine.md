# Operator Doctrine

## Core Principles

### Waiting Is the Default

The manuscript supports waiting. It does not support rushing.

- 38% of the text encodes deliberate non-intervention (OPS-1)
- High waiting density correlates with lower risk (OPS-5)
- LINK operations dampen engagement intensity (r=-0.71, OPS-5)
- Conservative stabilization paths always exist (OPS-4)

### Escalation Is Irreversible

Once engagement increases, it cannot be undone within the text.

- 3 prohibited transitions worsen all pressure axes (OPS-4)
- High-CEI commitment has no corresponding exit (OPS-5)
- Exit from dominated regime requires accumulated pressure (OPS-4)
- Moving down is easier than moving up (ratio=1.44, OPS-5)

### Restart Requires Low Engagement

Recovery is only available from conservative positions.

- 3 restart-capable folios, all at low CEI (OPS-6)
- Restart placement at 1.9th percentile of CEI (OPS-6)
- Restart-capable programs have higher stability (0.589 vs 0.393, OPS-3)
- High-engagement positions are traps without restart (OPS-6.A)

### The Text Holds Position, Not Escape

Navigation is local, not global.

- Local CEI smoothing is intentional (d=1.89, OPS-6)
- Global navigation is worse than random (d=-7.33, OPS-6)
- Trap regions exist and are tolerated (OPS-6.A)
- Human-track anchors during waiting, not during navigation (OPS-6.A)

### Throughput Is Transient

Speed is borrowed, not owned.

- REGIME_3 is dominated on all axes (OPS-3)
- Entered under acute time pressure, exited under accumulated risk (OPS-4)
- No sustainable equilibrium at high-engagement (OPS-4)
- Time-critical operation is passage, not destination (OPS-4)

## Behavioral Boundaries

### STRUCTURALLY ENCOURAGED

| Behavior | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Wait during uncertainty | LINK density 38% (OPS-1) |
| Operate within moderate engagement | 78% balanced intervention (OPS-1) |
| Maintain conservative stabilization options | Paths always exist (OPS-4) |
| Use local position markers | 99.6% LINK-proximal (HTCS, OPS-6.A) |
| Accept slow convergence | Time-stability tradeoff (OPS-3) |

### STRUCTURALLY DISCOURAGED

| Behavior | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Escalate without necessity | Prohibited transitions (OPS-4) |
| Remain at high engagement | REGIME_3 dominated (OPS-3) |
| Expect global navigation support | Navigation rejected (OPS-6) |
| Rely on recovery from high-CEI | No restart at high engagement (OPS-6) |

### STRUCTURALLY IGNORED

| Behavior | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Material selection | No encoding (Model Boundary) |
| Sensory judgment | External to text (Model Boundary) |
| Stopping decisions | No endpoint markers (frozen grammar) |
| Error recovery from traps | No compensation signal (OPS-6.A) |

## Operational Summary

The manuscript enforces a doctrine of **patient commitment**:

1. Wait rather than act
2. Commit only when pressure demands
3. Accept that commitment is irreversible
4. Restart only from conservative positions
5. Do not expect rescue from high-engagement regions

The text assumes an operator who **already knows the process**. It provides position-holding during passive phases, not guidance for active intervention.
