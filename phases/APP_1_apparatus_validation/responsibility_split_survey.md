# Test 1: Guild Manual Responsibility Survey

**Question:** Do historical apparatus manuals assume exactly the same human responsibilities as the Voynich controller?

**Verdict:** PARTIAL MATCH - Historical manuals share some omissions but ALSO include sensory instruction that the Voynich controller refuses to encode.

---

## What the Voynich Controller Encodes vs. Refuses (from OJLM-1)

### ENCODES:
- Legality (what operations are grammatically legal)
- Compatibility (what combinations are allowed)
- Recovery routes (escape transitions)
- Safety envelope (forbidden transitions)

### REFUSES TO ENCODE:
- Sensory calibration ("what does 'right' feel like")
- Timing intuition ("when is it done")
- Phase recognition ("when has transition occurred")
- Equipment feel ("how this specific apparatus behaves")
- Trouble recognition ("early warning of problems")

## Historical Sources Surveyed

### Source 1: Brunschwig's Liber de arte distillandi (1500)

**What It ENCODES:**
- Apparatus construction (furnace building, brick molds)
- Assembly instructions (luting recipes, vessel connections)
- Temperature method categories (horse dung, water bath, sand bath, naked fire)
- Storage rules (duration, freezing avoidance)
- Basic failure warnings (overflow, sealing)

**What It REFUSES TO ENCODE (matching Voynich):**
- Basic familiarity with plant properties → ASSUMED
- Humoral theory knowledge → ASSUMED
- Furnace operation experience → ASSUMED

**What It INCLUDES (NOT matching Voynich):**
- Explicit sensory cues: "when the streaks in the alembic begin to branch, and thick broad drops form in the helmet as if it were sweating on the inside, then the spirits are gone"
- Taste verification: "catch some of the distilled wine from the helmet in a glass and taste it on the tongue"
- Touch tests: Water bath "must not get so hot that one cannot bear to keep a finger in it"
- Visual deterioration markers: "Cloudy material at the bottom of the flask and a reddish tint"
- Viscosity test: "a drop on a thumb nail: if it does not run off soon, [the water] should be discarded"

**Assessment:** MISMATCH - Brunschwig EXPLAINS sensory cues that Voynich OMITS.

---

### Source 2: John French's The Art of Distillation (1651)

**What It ENCODES:**
- Four degrees of fire explicitly named and defined
- Furnace types and their uses
- Vessel materials and their limitations
- Pelican apparatus definition: "when any liquor is so placed in digestion that it shall rise up and fall down... we use a pelican"
- Timing for specific processes: "Circulate this in a pelican with a moderate heat for the space of a month"

**What It REFUSES TO ENCODE (matching Voynich):**
- Understanding that "philosophers...expressed it enigmatically" → ASSUMED
- Basic chemical terminology → ASSUMED
- Apparatus assembly skill → ASSUMED

**What It INCLUDES (NOT matching Voynich):**
- Explicit temperature definitions: "First degree...only a warmth, as is that of horse dung, of the sun, of warm water"
- Timing guidance: "things are sooner putrefied in cloudy weather than in fair"
- Failure warnings with causes: "vessels filled too full cause overflow"; "sudden temperature changes crack glass"

**Assessment:** MISMATCH - French EXPLAINS fire degrees that Voynich OMITS.

---

### Source 3: Alchemical Secrecy Tradition (General Pattern)

**What Is Written (in code):**
- Recipes with intentional gaps: John of Rupescissa's formulas "omit crucial ingredients"
- Hidden statements: "the whole secret is in salt" (salt not mentioned in ingredient list)
- "Code and metaphor routinely used by alchemists to hide their knowledge"

**What Is Transmitted Orally/Experimentally:**
- Apprenticeship knowledge via demonstration
- Master-disciple relationships for "philosophical" reading
- "Reading alchemically means reading philosophically...approaching texts on multiple levels"

**Assessment:** PARTIAL MATCH - Secrecy tradition omits key content, but omissions are DELIBERATE HIDING (cryptographic), not STRUCTURAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT of non-codifiability.

---

### Source 4: Medieval Perfumery Apprenticeship

**Training Model:**
- "In the past, Master Perfumers took on apprentices to whom they passed on their knowledge directly"
- "It typically takes about 7 years to train a perfumer"
- "When one trains in the traditional way as an apprentice, 'you really are told nothing'"

**What Is NOT Written:**
- Sensory calibration for smell assessment
- Equipment-specific behavior
- Timing intuition for extraction completion
- Trouble recognition for off-notes

**Assessment:** STRONG MATCH - Perfumery apprenticeship model assumes tacit knowledge transfer through observation, not instruction.

## Critical Distinction

### Brunschwig/French Pattern (EXPLAIN)
These manuals attempt to codify sensory knowledge. They DESCRIBE what "right" looks, feels, and tastes like. They provide explicit markers:
- "thick broad drops...as if it were sweating"
- "taste it on the tongue"
- "keep a finger in it"

This is **pedagogical instruction** - teaching novices through explicit description.

### Alchemical Pattern (HIDE)
Alchemical texts deliberately omit crucial information as protection. Gaps are cryptographic, not structural. The reader COULD be told but IS NOT.

### Perfumery Pattern (ASSUME)
The apprenticeship model assumes knowledge transfer through observation and imitation, not instruction. Tacit knowledge is structurally non-codifiable.

### Voynich Pattern (STRUCTURAL OMISSION)
The Voynich controller omits sensory/timing knowledge as a **design principle** (C469 - Categorical Resolution). It encodes WHAT categories apply, but refuses to encode WHERE in those categories you are. This is neither pedagogy nor secrecy - it is **acknowledgment of non-codifiability**.

---

## Verdict

### Does Any Manual Match the Voynich Responsibility Split?

**Brunschwig:** ❌ NO - Includes sensory instruction Voynich omits
**French:** ❌ NO - Includes temperature and timing instruction Voynich omits
**Alchemical:** ❌ NO - Omissions are cryptographic, not structural
**Perfumery:** ✅ PARTIAL - Apprenticeship model matches; no written manual to compare

### Key Finding

The Voynich controller's responsibility split is **anomalous** among surviving early modern distillation manuals:

1. It is NOT pedagogical (doesn't explain sensory cues)
2. It is NOT cryptographic (doesn't hide recoverable secrets)
3. It IS structural (acknowledges what cannot be written)

The closest match is the **unwritten** perfumery tradition - but that tradition has no surviving manuals to compare, precisely BECAUSE such manuals may be structurally impossible.

---

## Axis 1 Result: DISTINCTIVE MATCH

The Voynich controller exhibits a responsibility split that:
- DIFFERS from Brunschwig/French (which explain sensory knowledge)
- DIFFERS from alchemical texts (which hide recoverable secrets)
- MATCHES the perfumery apprenticeship model (which assumes non-codifiable tacit knowledge)

**Implication:** If the Voynich apparatus required a written manual, and that manual exists, then either:
1. No other surviving manual describes the same apparatus, OR
2. The apparatus requires a unique division of responsibility that other manuals do not exhibit
