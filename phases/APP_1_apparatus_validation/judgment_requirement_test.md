**Question:** Does the circulatory reflux apparatus (pelican) require exactly the 13 judgment types identified in OJLM-1?

**Verdict:** YES - All 13 required; instrumented systems reduce count.

## The 13 Judgment Types (from OJLM-1)

### Watch Closely (6 types)
| # | Type | What Cannot Be Encoded |
|---|------|------------------------|
| 1 | TEMPERATURE | Continuous thermal state (touch-based) |
| 2 | PHASE_TRANSITION | Visual pattern recognition |
| 3 | QUALITY_PURITY | Sensory quality assessment |
| 4 | TIMING | Process completion state |
| 5 | MATERIAL_STATE | Flow/behavior abnormality |
| 6 | STABILITY | Holistic normal vs abnormal |

### Forbidden Intervention (3 types)
| # | Type | Why Forbidden |
|---|------|---------------|
| 7 | EQUILIBRIUM_ESTABLISHMENT | Intervention destabilizes complex dependencies |
| 8 | PHASE_TRANSITION | Corrupts both phases during unstable state |
| 9 | PURIFICATION_CYCLE | Loses partial progress from incomplete cycle |

### Tacit Knowledge (4 types)
| # | Type | Why Non-Codifiable |
|---|------|-------------------|
| 10 | SENSORY_CALIBRATION | Identity-dependent baseline |
| 11 | EQUIPMENT_FEEL | Instance-specific behavior |

## Pelican Apparatus Analysis

### Apparatus Definition

From John French (1651):
> "CIRCULATION is when any liquor is so placed in digestion that it shall rise up and fall down, rise up and fall down, and so do continually, and thereby become more digested and mature, for which use for the most part we use a pelican."

**Key features:**
- Two side-arms feeding condensed vapors back into body
- Continuous internal circulation
- No product removal until cycle complete
- Temperature-driven self-regulating system

---

## Judgment Requirements for Pelican Operation

### Type 1: TEMPERATURE ✅ REQUIRED

**Why the pelican requires it:**
- Heat must be "moderate" (French: "circulate...with a moderate heat")
- No thermometer - operator must judge by touch, behavior
- Too hot = destruction; too cold = no circulation
- Water bath check: "must not get so hot that one cannot bear to keep a finger in it" (Brunschwig)

**Would instruments reduce this?** YES - A thermometer eliminates touch-based judgment.

---

### Type 2: PHASE_TRANSITION ✅ REQUIRED

**Why the pelican requires it:**
- Operator must recognize when spirits are exhausted
- "When the streaks in the alembic begin to branch, and thick broad drops form" (Brunschwig)
- Visual pattern recognition of phase change
- No colorimeter or refractometer available

**Would instruments reduce this?** YES - Continuous density/refractive index monitoring.

---

### Type 3: QUALITY_PURITY ✅ REQUIRED

**Why the pelican requires it:**
- "Taste it on the tongue. Thus you will sense whether it is watery or whether it still has more power" (Brunschwig)
- No chemical assay available
- Product quality = sensory assessment
- "Cloudy material at the bottom" = visual purity check

**Would instruments reduce this?** YES - Gas chromatography or spectrometry.

---

### Type 4: TIMING ✅ REQUIRED

**Why the pelican requires it:**
- "Circulate this in a pelican with a moderate heat for the space of a month" (French)
- But "month" is nominal - actual timing varies
- No clock-based automation
- Completion = sensory assessment, not timer

**Would instruments reduce this?** PARTIALLY - Process control could automate endpoint detection.

---

### Type 5: MATERIAL_STATE ✅ REQUIRED

**Why the pelican requires it:**
- Must monitor flow behavior in circulation
- "Rise up and fall down...continually"
- Abnormal flow = system problem
- Viscosity changes indicate state changes

**Would instruments reduce this?** YES - Flow meters and viscometers.

---

### Type 6: STABILITY ✅ REQUIRED

**Why the pelican requires it:**
- Equilibrium must establish and maintain
- "At steady state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray is at equilibrium"
- Operator must judge "normal operation" holistically
- No single indicator sufficient

**Would instruments reduce this?** PARTIALLY - Multiple sensors could integrate.

---

### Type 7: EQUILIBRIUM_ESTABLISHMENT (Prohibition) ✅ REQUIRED

**Why the pelican requires it:**
- Reflux systems must reach steady state
- "Wait for the reflux drum level to reach at least 50%"
- Intervention during establishment disrupts equilibrium
- The pelican's value IS the equilibrium state

**Would instruments reduce this?** NO - Even with instruments, the prohibition remains.

---

### Type 8: PHASE_TRANSITION (Prohibition) ✅ REQUIRED

**Why the pelican requires it:**
- During transition, both phases are unstable
- Cannot interrupt circulation mid-cycle
- "The process cannot be rushed and must be allowed to unfold naturally"
- Fourth degree fire forbidden because it "coerces" nature

**Would instruments reduce this?** NO - Physical constraint, not information gap.

---

### Type 9: PURIFICATION_CYCLE (Prohibition) ✅ REQUIRED

**Why the pelican requires it:**
- "Repeated cycles of reflection, release, and refinement"
- Each cycle must complete
- Interruption = partial progress lost
- "Reinfusion allowed no more than twice" (Brunschwig)

**Would instruments reduce this?** NO - Cycle integrity is physical, not informational.

---

### Type 10: SENSORY_CALIBRATION ✅ REQUIRED

**Why the pelican requires it:**
- "Right" temperature = learned baseline
- "Right" color = learned baseline
- Each operator develops personal reference
- Cannot be standardized without instruments

**Would instruments reduce this?** YES - Calibrated instruments replace personal baselines.

---

### Type 11: EQUIPMENT_FEEL ✅ REQUIRED

**Why the pelican requires it:**
- Each pelican behaves slightly differently
- Glass thickness, shape variations, luting quality
- Operator learns THIS apparatus
- Transfer to new equipment requires re-learning

**Would instruments reduce this?** PARTIALLY - Standardization helps but doesn't eliminate.

---

### Type 12: TIMING_INTUITION ✅ REQUIRED

**Why the pelican requires it:**
- "Ready" is pattern recognition across multiple signals
- No single indicator suffices
- Expert knows BEFORE explicit markers
- Integration of thermal, visual, temporal cues

**Would instruments reduce this?** PARTIALLY - ML could approximate but requires training data.

---

### Type 13: TROUBLE_RECOGNITION ✅ REQUIRED

**Why the pelican requires it:**
- "Unusual" requires knowing "usual"
- Each installation has baseline
- Early warning signals are subtle
- Must filter false alarms from real problems

**Would instruments reduce this?** PARTIALLY - Anomaly detection requires historical data.

## Axis 3 Result: EXACT MATCH

**Pre-instrumental pelican apparatus requires ALL 13 judgment types.**

**Instrumented systems reduce count to 3-7.**

This validates that:
1. The Voynich controller's judgment omissions match what a pre-instrumental pelican requires
2. Instruments would have reduced judgment load (but didn't exist)
3. The 13 types are not arbitrary - they are structurally necessary

**Key finding:** The prohibitions (Types 7-9) remain even with full instrumentation. This matches C490's architectural character - some constraints are physical, not informational.
