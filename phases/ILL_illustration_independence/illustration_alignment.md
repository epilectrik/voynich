# Illustration Alignment

> **PURPOSE**: Speculate on how illustrations might function as non-operational human memory aids.

> **STATUS**: EXPLICITLY SPECULATIVE AND NON-BINDING

## Locked Finding: Illustrations Are Epiphenomenal

From Phase ILL (Illustration Coupling Analysis):

| Test | Result | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| Swap invariance | p = 1.0 | Text-illustration pairing has no operational effect |
| Distribution shift | 94% classifier accuracy | IF and NIF text differs (Currier A/B) |
| Metrics | 1/5 significant | Correlation exists but is non-causal |

**Verdict**: Illustrations do NOT constrain execution. They are **decorative or organizational**, not operational.

**This analysis respects that finding**. We speculate only on *human-facing functions*—what the pictures remind the operator of, not what they make the grammar do.

## Hypothesis: Illustrations as Material Category Markers

**HISTORICAL ALIGNMENT** (MEDIUM confidence):

Medieval technical manuscripts often used illustrations as:
- **Section headers** — "This part covers aromatic herbs"
- **Category markers** — "Programs here relate to this kind of material"
- **Mnemonic anchors** — "Remember which substrate family this is"

The Voynich illustrations may serve the same function.

### Plant Illustration Types (STRUCTURAL SUPPORT + SPECULATION)

| Visual Feature | Possible Category | Example Substrates | Confidence |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Prominent roots** | Root-processed materials | Dried roots, rhizomes | MEDIUM |
| **Leafy/frondy** | Leaf-based materials | Dried leaves, fronds | MEDIUM |
| **Flowering** | Flower/aromatic | Dried flowers, petals | MEDIUM |
| **Pod/seed structures** | Seed-based | Seeds, drupes | LOW |
| **Blue/water associations** | Aqueous processing | Water-based extractions | LOW |
| **Root with droplets** | Resinous materials | Saps, gums, resins | LOW |

**Workshop Interpretation** (PURE SPECULATION):

> *"When you turn to a page with a big rooty plant, you know those programs work well with root material. The picture isn't telling you WHAT root—you already know that from your training. It's reminding you of the category."*

---

## Botanical Recognizability

**Observation**: Voynich plant illustrations are notoriously unidentifiable. Decades of attempts to match them to real species have failed.

### Strong Interpretation (PURE SPECULATION, LOW confidence):

The plants are **deliberately abstract** because:
- Specific identification isn't the point
- Category membership is what matters
- An aromatic flower is an aromatic flower—species varies by region

**Workshop Interpretation**:

> *"The book doesn't show you 'this exact plant.' It shows you 'a plant of this type.' You bring the local knowledge of which plants fit the type."*

### Weak Interpretation (PURE SPECULATION, LOW confidence):

The plants are **stylized memory aids**:
- "Flower on top, roots on bottom" = general schema
- Actual species determined by oral tradition
- The picture triggers the memory, not the identification

**Historical Parallel**: Many medieval herbals show highly stylized plants. Identification required prior knowledge.

---

## Roots Prominence

**Observation**: Many Voynich plant illustrations emphasize roots—often shown as prominently as or more than the above-ground parts.

### Speculation (MEDIUM confidence):

| Root Feature | Possible Meaning | Grammar Alignment |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Large visible roots** | Root-based processing emphasized | CLASS_A (porous, slow diffusion) |
| **Colored/detailed roots** | Multiple root types distinguished | Different programs per substrate |
| **Root with droplets** | Resinous or exuding | CLASS_B (hydrophobic, dense) |

**Workshop Interpretation** (PURE SPECULATION):

> *"The prominent roots remind you: this section's programs are designed for root materials. Different root types need different handling—the more aggressive programs work better on dense roots, the gentler ones for fibrous roots."*

---

## Aromatic vs. Structural Plants

### Visual Distinction (STRUCTURAL SUPPORT for existence, SPECULATION for meaning)

| Visual Type | Description | Speculative Category |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Delicate flowering** | Fine structures, visible florets | Aromatic, volatile-bearing |
| **Robust leafy** | Dense, thick leaves | Structural, slow-release |
| **Seed-bearing** | Visible pods, seeds | Oily, dense-centered |
| **Root-dominant** | Large roots, small tops | Underground-stored |

**Workshop Interpretation** (PURE SPECULATION):

> *"Delicate flowers need the conservative programs—they're fragile. The chunky root plants can take more aggressive handling. The picture tells you the material type at a glance."*

---

## Section Organization Hypothesis

**STRUCTURAL SUPPORT**: Illustrated folios (IF) cluster in certain sections; non-illustrated (NIF) in others.

**HISTORICAL ALIGNMENT**: This matches medieval manuscript organization where:
- Illustrated sections introduce topics
- Text-heavy sections provide procedures
- Illustrations mark transitions

### Speculative Section Structure

| Section Type | Illustrations | Text Type | Speculative Function |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Herbal A/B | Plants | Currier A | Material category markers |
| Cosmological | Diagrams | Mixed | Timing/seasonal markers |
| Recipe/pharmaceutical | Minimal | Currier B | Pure procedure |

**Workshop Interpretation** (PURE SPECULATION):

> *"The picture pages tell you 'what kind of material.' The recipe pages tell you 'how to run the apparatus.' You flip back to the picture to remember what you're processing, then flip forward to find the right program."*

---

## Illustrations as Harvesting Cues

**PURE SPECULATION** (LOW confidence):

Some Voynich plant illustrations might remind operators of:
- What the fresh plant looks like before drying
- Which parts to collect
- Seasonal appearance at harvest time

### Possible Cues

| Visual Feature | Possible Cue | Evidence |
|----------------|--------------|----------|
| Flowering | Harvest at flowering | NONE (speculative) |
| Seed pods | Harvest when seeding | NONE (speculative) |
| Root prominence | Root is the target | Consistent with emphasis |
| Color coding | Ripeness indicator | NONE (speculative) |

**Important**: There is NO structural evidence for this. It is pure speculation based on what such illustrations *could* mean in a workshop context.

---

## Non-Plant Illustrations

### Cosmological/Circular Diagrams

**Observation**: The manuscript contains circular diagrams, zodiac imagery, and "calendar-like" pages.

**Structural Support**: These appear in distinct sections, not interspersed with plant illustrations.

**Speculation** (See `calendar_seasonality_hypotheses.md`):
- May mark temporal organization
- May indicate seasonal processing windows
- May be purely organizational (like chapter headers)

### "Pharmaceutical" Containers

**Observation**: Some pages show jar-like or container-like objects.

**Speculation** (LOW confidence):
- May mark finished-product sections
- May indicate storage requirements
- May be purely decorative

## Summary: What Illustrations Might Do

| Function | Confidence | Evidence Type |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Category markers** | MEDIUM | Structural (sections correlate with text type) |
| **Material reminders** | MEDIUM | Historical alignment (medieval herbals work this way) |
| **Mnemonic anchors** | MEDIUM | Consistent with expert-use design |
| **Harvesting cues** | LOW | Pure speculation |
| **Species identification** | VERY LOW | Decades of failed attempts |
| **Operational constraints** | FALSIFIED | Phase ILL: swap invariance p=1.0 |

---

## What Illustrations Do NOT Do (LOCKED)

| Claim | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Gate or constrain execution | FALSIFIED | Swap test p=1.0 |
| Determine program selection | FALSIFIED | Text-only grammar recovery |
| Encode operational meaning | FALSIFIED | Pure operational verdict |
| Require interpretation for use | FALSIFIED | Expert external knowledge assumed |

---

## Workshop Model (PURE SPECULATION)

An operator using this manuscript might:

1. **Know their materials** from training (not from the book)
2. **Recognize material categories** from illustration style
3. **Navigate to appropriate section** using picture cues
4. **Select program** based on text (not illustration)
5. **Run apparatus** following text instructions
6. **Judge outcome** externally (not encoded in book)

The illustrations are **wayfinding aids**, not **operational content**.

**Analogy** (LOW confidence):

> Like the photos in a modern industrial manual—they help you recognize which section you're in, but the procedures are in the text.

## What This Does NOT Claim

- ❌ Specific plant identifications
- ❌ Illustration meanings
- ❌ Operational role for any image
- ❌ Historical identity
- ❌ Geographic origin
