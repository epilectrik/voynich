VISUAL CODING GUIDE FOR VOYNICH PILOT STUDY
======================================================================

This guide accompanies visual_data_template.csv
Code each folio by entering values in the corresponding column.

CRITICAL: Use UNDETERMINED when:
  - Damage obscures the feature
  - Artistic ambiguity prevents clear determination
  - Feature falls between categories

DO NOT use UNDETERMINED when:
  - Feature is clearly absent (use ABSENT or NO)
  - You're uncertain about identification (make best judgment)
