## Detailed Use-Context Assessments

### 1. Aurum Potabile (Final Product)

#### Documented Use Contexts

**Elite Medicine & Court Practice (TIER 2)**
- Francis Anthony (1550-1603) achieved "great success and notoriety" dispensing aurum potabile in London
- Prosecution by Royal College of Physicians indicates tension between licensed physicians and chemical practitioners
- "This honeyed preparation was widely coveted, it inspired chemists late into the 17th century including Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton"
- "Gold-imbued recipes made their way into chemistry manuals by the likes of French medical professionals Jean Beguin and Christophe Glaser, and even the short-lived Portuguese Pope John XXI"

**Paracelsian Medicine (TIER 2)**
- Paracelsus (1493-1541): "Of all Elixirs, Gold is supreme and the most important for us"
- Listed among "medicamenta comfortativa" (comforting medicines)
- Used for "epilepsy to mania" as cure-all

#### Operator Class
- Paracelsian physicians (unlicensed, chemical medicine tradition)
- Court empirics (private practice for aristocrats)
- Royal College opponents (mainstream physicians rejected it)

#### Frequency & Exclusivity
- **Rare:** Required gold as base material (expensive)
- **Court-level:** Aristocratic patronage required; "the king has asked for drinkable gold" (1677)
- **Restricted to elites:** Cost and risk profile limited to wealthy patrons

#### Failure & Risk in Use
- **Auric fever:** "Profuse sweats, very abundant flow of urine"
- **Gastrointestinal irritation, kidney damage**
- **Deaths documented:** Diane de Poitiers died at 66 from daily consumption
- **Social backlash:** Francis Anthony prosecuted by Royal College of Physicians

#### Decoupling Statement
> **There is NO evidence that the Voynich Manuscript itself encodes the downstream medical use of aurum potabile.**

The manuscript may describe preparation but does not encode consumption, dosage, or medical application.

### 2. Mercurial Elixirs (Final Product)

#### Documented Use Contexts

**Imperial Court Medicine (TIER 2)**
- Chinese emperors employed court alchemists "to concoct immortality potions"
- "The alchemical practice of concocting elixirs of immortality from metallic and mineral substances began circa the 4th century BCE"
- Explicitly for immortality, not medical treatment of disease
- Emperor Xianzong (818 CE) employed court alchemist Liu Mi, even named him governor of Taizhou prefecture

**University-Adjacent Natural Philosophy (TIER 3)**
- Theoretical texts documented elixir preparation
- Zhang zhenren jinshi lingsha lun (8th century): "emphasized the poisonous nature of gold, silver, lead, mercury, and arsenic"
- Attempted detoxification methods: "put it in three-year-old wine, add sal ammoniac and boil it for 100 days"

#### Operator Class
- Daoist adepts (neidan tradition)
- Court alchemists (imperial patronage)
- Imperial physicians (when elixirs adopted as medicine)

#### Frequency & Exclusivity
- **Rare:** Imperial-level practice only
- **Court-exclusive:** Common knowledge of dangers did not prevent imperial use
- **Highly restricted:** Alchemists executed after emperor's death, then successors employed new alchemists

#### Failure & Risk in Use
- **At least 5-6 Tang dynasty emperors died:** "the newly enthroned emperor understandably executed the Daoist alchemists"
- **Emperor Ai (d. 365):** "No longer knew what was going on around him"
- **Emperor Wuzong (d. 846):** "Very irritable, losing all normal self-control"
- **Qin Shi Huang:** First Emperor of China died at 49
- **Lady Dai:** Autopsy found "abnormally high levels" of mercury in organs

#### Decoupling Statement
> **There is NO evidence that the Voynich Manuscript itself encodes the downstream consumption of mercurial elixirs for immortality.**

Chinese elixir tradition is geographically and culturally distinct from European manuscript context. Even if preparation is similar, application differs.

## Cross-Material Observations

### Common Properties of Use Ecosystem

1. **Guild restriction:** All materials used within expert-only, guild-protected or court-sponsored contexts
2. **High-value endpoints:** Final products served elite patrons (kings, emperors, aristocrats)
3. **Multi-domain overlap:** Platform reagents (Mercury, Vitriol, Sal Ammoniac) appear in BOTH alchemy and metallurgy
4. **Risk acceptance:** Extreme hazard profiles accepted due to perceived value of outcomes
5. **Incomplete disclosure:** Use contexts characterized by secrecy, prosecution, and social regulation

### Distinction Between Preparation and Use

| Aspect | Preparation (EXT-5A) | Use (EXT-5B) |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| Operator | Alchemist/adept | Physician, metallurgist, dyer |
| Risk | Process hazards (phase, contamination) | Application hazards (poisoning, corrosion) |
| Knowledge | Operational (how to make) | Functional (how to apply) |
| Documentation | Encoded in manual | External to manual |

**Key Finding:** The Voynich Manuscript—if it encodes preparation—does NOT encode downstream use. These are separate knowledge domains with different operators, risks, and documentation traditions.
