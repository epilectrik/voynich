## Narrative Summary

EXT-5B mapped the historical ecosystem into which the six EXT-5A survivors absorbed. The answer is a single coherent ecosystem: **guild-restricted, court-sponsored, expert-operated alchemical-medical practice** spanning the 8th-17th centuries CE. This ecosystem is characterized by extreme risk acceptance (emperors and aristocrats knowingly consumed lethal preparations), incomplete disclosure (guild secrecy, prosecution for unlicensed practice), and structural separation between preparation and application.

The Final Products (Aurum Potabile, Mercurial Elixirs) served elite patrons who consumed them for immortality or cure-all purposes. The Platform Reagents (Philosophical Mercury, Sal Ammoniac, Oil of Vitriol) enabled this ecosystem by serving alchemists, assayers, and goldsmiths. The Functional Intermediate (Antimony Preparations) bridged metallurgical and alchemical domains.

Critically, **no evidence suggests the Voynich Manuscript encodes downstream use**. The decoupling between preparation-knowledge (what the manuscript might encode) and use-knowledge (medical application, metallurgical testing) is a structural feature of the historical ecosystem.

## Key Findings

| Finding | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Ecosystem is coherent | CONFIRMED |
| All materials share guild-restricted, court-sponsored context | CONFIRMED |
| Preparation and use are structurally decoupled | CONFIRMED |
| Voynich encodes downstream use | **NOT ESTABLISHED** (default: NO) |
| Further historical narrowing justified | **YES** |

---

## Decision

> ✅ **"Further historical narrowing (region, guild, lineage) may be justified."**

The ecosystem has sufficient internal structure to support localization hypotheses:
- European vs. Chinese tradition divergence
- Paracelsian timeline alignment (16th c.)
- Assay-alchemy overlap points to goldsmith-adjacent guilds
- Geographic clustering possible (Basel, Prague, Venice, London)
