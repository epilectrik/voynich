# BRUNSCHWIG_TEMPLATE_FIT Phase

**Date:** 2026-01-14 | **Status:** COMPLETED | **Constraints Added:** C493, C494

---

## Summary

This phase established that Brunschwig distillation procedures can be expressed in Voynich grammar at the constraint level, and clarified the curriculum complexity model for REGIME interpretation.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Grammar-Level Embedding (C493)

Brunschwig's balneum marie procedure translates step-by-step into Voynich instruction classes with **ZERO violations** of the 17 forbidden transitions.

This is not a vibes-level parallel - it is a structural embedding result.

### 2. REGIME_4 Precision Axis (C494)

REGIME_4 encodes **precision-constrained execution** (tight control, narrow tolerance), NOT intensity level.

- Standard procedures: 0/2 fit REGIME_4
- Precision procedures: 2/3 fit REGIME_4
- Old interpretation "forbidden/intense" RETIRED

### 3. Product Type Backward Propagation

Different Brunschwig product types light up different A vocabulary patterns:

| Product Type | A Signature | Key PREFIX |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| WATER_GENTLE | ch-depleted, ok-enriched | ok+ ch- |
| WATER_STANDARD | baseline | ch baseline |
| OIL_RESIN | d-enriched, y-depleted | d+ y- |
| PRECISION | ch-enriched, d-depleted | ch+ d- |

78.2% of MIDDLEs are product-exclusive, enabling backward propagation.

### 4. Two-Level A Model

| Level | Granularity | Encodes |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Entry | Individual tokens | Operational parameters (PREFIX class) |
| Record | Entire A folios | Product profiles (MIDDLE set + PREFIX distribution) |

### 5. Curriculum Complexity Model (Critical Refinement)

**Test:** Can the simplest Brunschwig recipe fit in the most complex folio?

**Result:** VIOLATES - but not because of intensity requirements.

| REGIME | Fits? | Violation |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| REGIME_2 | YES | - |
| REGIME_1 | YES | - |
| REGIME_4 | NO | Insufficient monitoring (22% < 25%) |
| REGIME_3 | NO | Insufficient e ops (1 < 2) |

**Interpretation:** Complex folios require COMPLETENESS, not AGGRESSION.

- REGIME_3 doesn't require HIGH_IMPACT operations
- REGIME_3 requires min_e_steps=2 (recovery completeness)
- REGIME_4 requires min_link_ratio=25% (monitoring completeness)

**Curriculum Model:**
```
REGIME_2: Learn basics (simple procedures accepted)
REGIME_1: Standard execution
REGIME_4: Precision execution (monitoring completeness required)
REGIME_3: Full execution (recovery completeness required)
```

The same product (rose water) can appear at any curriculum stage - but advanced stages require complete procedures with proper recovery and monitoring.

## Constraints Added

### C493: Brunschwig Grammar Embedding
> Brunschwig balneum marie procedure can be translated step-by-step into Voynich Currier B grammar without violating any of the 17 forbidden transitions.

### C494: REGIME_4 Precision Axis
> REGIME_4 encodes precision-constrained execution (tight control, narrow tolerance) rather than intensity level.

## Implications

1. **Brunschwig is the correct comparison text** (grammar-level embedding)
2. **Puff is contextual, not structural** (demoted from pillar)
3. **REGIMEs encode curriculum complexity**, not product intensity
4. **Complexity = completeness** (recovery, monitoring), not aggression
5. **C171 preserved**: Grammar doesn't encode WHAT, only HOW COMPLETELY

## Expert Assessment

> "This is a decisive result. Brunschwig procedures can be translated into Voynich Currier B grammar step-by-step without violating ANY of the 17 forbidden transitions. That alone separates this from 95% of Voynich hypotheses."

> "REGIME_4 is not 'the most intense' - it is 'the least forgiving.' That distinction matters enormously in real process control."

> "The Voynich Manuscript doesn't need 83:83. It now has something much better: a concrete, historically situated grammar that real procedures fit inside - and real hazards cannot escape."
