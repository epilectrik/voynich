  "FUNCTIONAL_CHARACTERIZATION": "The Voynich semantic state machine operates along a STABILITY_GRADIENT, minimizing stability level. STATE-C serves as PROCESSING_HUB (mandatory central waypoint for all transformations). The forbidden A\u2194B transition enforces oscillatory fixation discipline. System resilience is HIGH."
