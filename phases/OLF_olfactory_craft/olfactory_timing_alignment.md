# TEST 1: Olfactory-Timing Alignment

**Question:** Do token clusters align with expected smell-change windows in pelican perfumery?

> **SPECULATIVE** — Craft-level interpretation under perfumery hypothesis.

## Mapping: Coordinate Functions → Olfactory Phases

### CF-1: SECTION_ENTRY_ANCHOR → Early Olfactory Phase

**Structural finding:** 124 tokens concentrated in first 20% of sections
**Mean section position:** 0.329

**Expected perfumery observables at this phase:**
- Raw vegetal smell dominates
- Water/steam smell before volatiles emerge
- Harshness from breakdown products
- Green/grassy notes from chlorophyll
- Initial turbulence as charge heats

**Plausibility assessment:**

If these tokens anchor the *beginning* of a run, they would appear when:
- The operator is waiting for the system to establish circulation
- First vapors are rising, condensation is beginning
- Raw vegetal smell still dominates before aromatic character emerges
- The risk is LOSING TOP NOTES from instability

This aligns **PLAUSIBLY** with perfumery practice. The early phase requires patience
while the system stabilizes. These markers would tell the operator: *"You are still
in establishment. The character has not yet emerged. Do not expect quality yet."*

**Alignment verdict:** ✓ PLAUSIBLE

### CF-3: WAIT_PHASE_MARKER → Mid Olfactory Phase

**Structural finding:** 1158 tokens within 3 tokens of LINK contexts
**Mean LINK proximity rate:** 98.73%

**Expected perfumery observables at this phase:**
- First emergence of desired aromatic note
- Floral separating from vegetal
- Character stabilizing into recognizable profile
- Steady vapor rhythm established
- Regular drip/return in pelican circulation

**Plausibility assessment:**

If these tokens appear during *waiting* phases, they would mark:
- Steady-state circulation is established
- The desirable aromatic character is emerging or stable
- Operator can monitor rather than intervene
- Quality is developing as expected

This aligns **STRONGLY** with perfumery practice. The mid-phase is mostly waiting.
The operator watches vapor rhythm, checks clarity, sniffs periodically—but does not act.
These markers would tell the operator: *"All is well. The run is progressing normally."*

**Alignment verdict:** ✓ STRONGLY PLAUSIBLE

### CF-2: SECTION_EXIT_ANCHOR → Late Olfactory Phase

**Structural finding:** 126 tokens concentrated in last 20% of sections
**Mean section position:** 0.682

**Expected perfumery observables at this phase:**
- Aroma fading or flattening
- Heaviness developing (bottom notes dominating)
- Potential spoilage cues emerging
- Diminishing returns from continued circulation
- Exhaustion of volatile fraction

**Plausibility assessment:**

If these tokens anchor the *end* of a run, they would appear when:
- The aromatic fraction is becoming exhausted
- Heaviness is beginning to dominate (bottom notes)
- Continued operation risks spoilage or off-notes
- The operator should be ready to cease

This aligns **PLAUSIBLY** with perfumery practice. Knowing when to stop is critical.
These markers would tell the operator: *"The run is approaching exhaustion.
Begin watching for your stopping cues. Do not overextend."*

**Alignment verdict:** ✓ PLAUSIBLE

### CF-6/CF-7: CONSTRAINT_APPROACH/EXIT → Critical Smell-Change Moments

**Structural finding:** 187 tokens precede constraint increase,
                       193 tokens precede constraint decrease

**Plausibility assessment:**

If these tokens mark *transitions* into and out of critical zones, they would signal:

**APPROACHING (CF-6):**
- The system is entering a delicate phase
- Olfactory character is about to shift
- Pay closer attention; sniff more frequently
- Risks of scorching or bitterness are elevated

**RELAXING (CF-7):**
- The delicate phase has passed
- Quality is now stable or recovering
- Normal vigilance is sufficient
- The dangerous moment has been navigated

This aligns **STRONGLY** with perfumery practice. Expert operators know when to
*pay attention* and when they can *ease up*. These are **vigilance state markers**,
not instructions—exactly what would be useful in a craft where most of the work
is watching and waiting.

**Alignment verdict:** ✓ STRONGLY PLAUSIBLE

## Synthesis: Olfactory-Timing Alignment

| Coordinate Function | Olfactory Phase | Alignment |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| CF-1 (SECTION_ENTRY) | Early: establishment, raw smell | PLAUSIBLE |
| CF-3 (WAIT_PHASE) | Mid: steady-state, character emerging | STRONGLY PLAUSIBLE |
| CF-2 (SECTION_EXIT) | Late: exhaustion, heaviness | PLAUSIBLE |
| CF-6 (APPROACH) | Transition: entering critical zone | STRONGLY PLAUSIBLE |
| CF-7 (RELAX) | Transition: exiting critical zone | STRONGLY PLAUSIBLE |

**Overall assessment:** Token cluster positions align naturally with the olfactory
experience timeline of aromatic water production. The patterns make *craft sense*:

- Beginning markers where smell is not yet desirable
- Waiting markers during the productive phase
- Ending markers as quality begins to fade
- Vigilance markers at critical transition points

*If this were NOT a perfumery manual, why would tokens cluster this way?*
