# TEST 2: Failure-Avoidance Semantics

**Question:** If tokens were warning memories, what failures would occur if ignored?

> **SPECULATIVE** — Craft-level interpretation under perfumery hypothesis.

---

## Interpretive Frame

We approach each token family as if it encodes:
> *"The author learned this the hard way. They are preventing you from repeating their mistake."*

In perfumery, failures are typically:
- **Irreversible** (burned character cannot be removed)
- **Sensory** (ruined product is detected by smell, not measurement)
- **Cumulative** (small mistakes compound over a long run)

## Failure-Story Table

| Token Family | Warning If Ignored | Failure Type | Craft Plausibility |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| CF-1 (SECTION_ENTRY) | "Do not rush establishment" | TOP_NOTE_LOSS | HIGH |
| CF-2 (SECTION_EXIT) | "Do not overextend" | SPOILAGE | HIGH |
| CF-3 (WAIT_PHASE) | "Do not interfere" | CHARACTER_DRIFT | MODERATE |
| CF-5 (PERSISTENCE) | "Maintain patience" | BITTERNESS | MODERATE |
| CF-6 (APPROACH) | "Watch closely now" | SCORCHING | HIGH |
| CF-7 (RELAX) | "Danger passed" | (prevention confirmed) | HIGH |

## Detailed Failure Stories

### CF-1: SECTION_ENTRY_ANCHOR

**Warning encoded:** *"The system is still establishing. Do not expect quality yet."*

**Failure if ignored:**
If the operator rushes this phase—applying too much heat too soon, or venting
before circulation stabilizes—the result is **TOP_NOTE_LOSS**:

- The most volatile (and most desirable) aromatic fractions escape
- The final product is flat, lacking brightness and lift
- This cannot be corrected by continued processing

**Craft plausibility:** HIGH
Every perfumer knows the first moments are delicate. The marker says: *wait*.

### CF-2: SECTION_EXIT_ANCHOR

**Warning encoded:** *"The run is approaching exhaustion. Prepare to stop."*

**Failure if ignored:**
If the operator continues beyond exhaustion—hoping to extract more—the result is **SPOILAGE**:

- Off-notes develop from breakdown products
- Mustiness or fermented character emerges
- The good product already obtained is contaminated

**Craft plausibility:** HIGH
Knowing when to stop is the hardest judgment. The marker says: *it's almost time*.

### CF-6: CONSTRAINT_APPROACH_MARKER

**Warning encoded:** *"You are entering a critical zone. Pay close attention."*

**Failure if ignored:**
If the operator fails to increase vigilance, the result is **SCORCHING**:

- A momentary lapse allows thermal damage
- Burned character permeates the entire batch
- Cannot be removed by filtering or further processing

**Craft plausibility:** HIGH
The author learned: *this is where I almost ruined it*. The marker says: *watch now*.

### CF-7: CONSTRAINT_EXIT_MARKER

**Warning encoded:** *"The critical moment has passed. You can ease up."*

**Failure if ignored:**
This marker prevents a *different* failure: **FATIGUE-INDUCED ERROR**

If the operator maintains maximum vigilance indefinitely:
- Attention degrades from exhaustion
- A later critical moment is missed
- The error occurs where it was least expected

**Craft plausibility:** HIGH
Conserving vigilance is as important as deploying it. The marker says: *relax now*.

## Synthesis: Failure-Avoidance Semantics

**What the author feared (inferred from token placement):**

1. **Rushing the start** → Loss of volatile character
2. **Overextending the end** → Spoilage and off-notes
3. **Inattention during transitions** → Thermal damage
4. **Unnecessary intervention during steady state** → Character drift

**Craft-level interpretation:**

The token families encode *not* what to do, but *what not to do*:

- ESTABLISHING: Don't rush
- RUNNING: Don't interfere
- APPROACHING: Don't relax
- RELAXING: Don't maintain unnecessary tension
- EXHAUSTING: Don't overextend

This is **precisely** how craft knowledge is transmitted:
*"Here is where I made mistakes. Don't repeat them."*
