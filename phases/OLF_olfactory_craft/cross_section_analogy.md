# TEST 4: Cross-Section Analogy Test

**Question:** Do different sections encode the *same kinds of situations* under different surface tokens?

> **SPECULATIVE** — Craft-level interpretation under perfumery hypothesis.

---

## What This Tests

If sections represent different *materials* or *recipes* (as the 83-program model suggests),
they should still have the *same kinds of situations*:

- Every run has an establishment phase
- Every run has a steady-state phase
- Every run has critical moments requiring vigilance
- Every run has an exhaustion phase

But if each section has private vocabulary, the *surface tokens* will differ
while the *situational roles* remain the same.

| B | 2.8% | 76.1% | 3.6% | 5.8% | 9.1% | 2.6% |
| C | 4.9% | 68.9% | 4.6% | 6.4% | 6.2% | 6.8% |
| H | 6.7% | 74.5% | 4.4% | 5.3% | 5.6% | 3.3% |
| P | 3.3% | 74.0% | 4.2% | 6.8% | 5.4% | 6.2% |
| S | 3.0% | 73.5% | 4.8% | 6.9% | 8.6% | 3.3% |
| T | 8.9% | 65.9% | 3.5% | 5.8% | 7.1% | 6.0% |

## Proportional Consistency Analysis

### SECTION_EARLY
**Present in all 8 sections** ✓

This function is *universal*—every section has tokens serving this role,
even though the specific tokens differ between sections.

### LINK_PROXIMAL
**Present in all 8 sections** ✓

This function is *universal*—every section has tokens serving this role,
even though the specific tokens differ between sections.

### SECTION_LATE
**Present in all 8 sections** ✓

This function is *universal*—every section has tokens serving this role,
even though the specific tokens differ between sections.

## Craft-Level Interpretation

**What the data shows:**

Different sections use *different tokens* for the *same situational roles*:

- Section H has its own ESTABLISHING vocabulary
- Section S has its own ESTABLISHING vocabulary
- But both vocabularies *mark the same kind of situation*

**Perfumery interpretation:**

This is exactly how craft naming works:

- A perfumer working rose water might call a phase *"the first sweetness"*
- The same perfumer working lavender might call it *"the first sharpness"*
- Both phrases refer to the same *structural moment*: emergence of character
- But the sensory experience differs, so the vocabulary differs

The section-specific vocabularies are **craft naming**:
- Same situational role
- Different experiential content
- Private terminology developed through practice

**Why this matters:**

If the manuscript encoded *abstract operational categories*, the vocabulary would be uniform.
But the vocabulary is section-specific while the *functional proportions* are similar.

This is the signature of *experienced craft*: universal roles with local naming.
