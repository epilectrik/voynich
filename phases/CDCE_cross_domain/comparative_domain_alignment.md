# Comparative Domain Alignment Analysis

> **PURPOSE**: Situate the locked Voynich control grammar among real continuous processes by engineering comparison, not historical identification.

## Locked Grammar Properties (Fixed)

| Property | Value | Engineering Implication |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| Operation mode | Continuous, non-halting | No batch completion signals |
| Geometry | Closed-loop G4/G5 only | Recirculation required |
| Damping operator | LINK (38% density) | Explicit waiting/settling |
| Hazard discipline | 17 bidirectional exclusions | Symmetrical failure prevention |
| Material sensitivity | Phase-stable only | CLASS_C (phase-changing) fails |
| Control surface | 3 axes, 1-D effective | Low-dimensional coupled control |
| Program library | 83 enumerated programs | No continuous tuning |
| Throughput priority | Stability >> speed | Conservative default |

## Axis 1: Control Style Comparison

| Domain | Endpoint-Free? | Damping-Heavy? | Expert-Operated? | Hazard-Disciplined? | ALIGNMENT |
|--------|----------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Reflux Distillation** | YES | YES | YES | YES | **HIGH** |
| **Circulation Conditioning** | YES | YES | YES | YES | **HIGH** |
| **Continuous Extraction** | Partial | YES | YES | Moderate | MED |
| **Long-Duration Equilibration** | YES | YES | Moderate | Moderate | MED |
| **Separation by Mobility** | Partial | YES | YES | Moderate | MED |
| **Industrial Washing Loops** | YES | Moderate | YES | Moderate | MED |
| **Purification Columns** | NO | Partial | YES | Partial | LOW |
| **Batch Fermentation** | NO | NO | Moderate | Partial | LOW |
| **Crystallization** | NO | NO | YES | NO | LOW |

### Control Style Verdict

Grammar aligns most strongly with **indefinite circulation systems** where:
- No natural completion point exists
- Damping/waiting is a primary control mechanism
- Operator expertise replaces automated feedback
- Hazard avoidance is symmetrical (approach from either direction equally forbidden)

## Axis 2: Geometry & Flow Topology

| Domain | Loop Type | Recirculation | Intrinsic Delay | Phase-Change Sensitivity | ALIGNMENT |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| **Pelican Alembic** | Fully closed | 100% | High | Avoids | **HIGH** |
| **Circulation Still** | Closed loop | 100% | High | Avoids | **HIGH** |
| **Recirculating Conditioner** | Closed loop | 100% | Moderate | Avoids | **HIGH** |
| **Continuous Extractor** | Partial loop | 50-80% | Moderate | Tolerates | MED |
| **Separation Column** | Open flow | 0% | Low | Tolerates | LOW |
| **Batch Vessel** | None | 0% | None | N/A | LOW |
| **Flow Reactor** | Open | 0% | Low | Requires | LOW |

### Geometry Verdict

Grammar requires:
- **Minimum 50% recirculation** (G3 threshold)
- **Intrinsic delay mechanism** (LINK effectiveness d=4.50 only in closed loops)
- **No phase-change tolerance** (CLASS_C = only failing material class)

This maps cleanly to **reflux-type circulation** where material returns to the vessel continuously and LINK encodes residence time.

## Axis 3: Program Library Structure

| Domain | Fixed Regimes? | Conservative Default? | Restart Protocols? | Rare Interventions? | ALIGNMENT |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Traditional Distillation** | YES (4 degrees) | YES | YES | YES | **HIGH** |
| **Circulation Conditioning** | Moderate | YES | Rare | Rare | MED |
| **Process Extraction** | Partial | Moderate | Rare | Moderate | MED |
| **Separation Processes** | NO (continuous tuning) | NO | NO | Frequent | LOW |
| **Pharmaceutical Synthesis** | YES | Moderate | NO | Moderate | LOW |
| **Modern Control Systems** | NO (PID loops) | NO | Automated | Rare | LOW |

### Library Structure Analysis

Grammar exhibits:
- **83 enumerated programs** (not continuous tuning)
- **3 restart-capable** (f50v, f57r, f82v) — explicit reset protocols
- **18% AGGRESSIVE programs** — rare high-risk interventions
- **55% MODERATE programs** — conservative baseline dominates

This matches **pre-modern expert-operated systems** where:
- Operator memorizes approved procedures
- No feedback automation exists
- Risky operations are exceptional
- Default behavior is cautious waiting

## Axis 4: Human Factors Alignment

| Domain | Learning Progression? | Local Safety Buffering? | Memorized Restart? | External Judgment? | ALIGNMENT |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Guild Training Manual** | YES | YES | YES | YES | **HIGH** |
| **Brunschwig-Era Distillation** | YES | YES | YES | YES | **HIGH** |
| **Expert Craft Practice** | YES | Implicit | Oral | YES | MED |
| **Modern SOP Manual** | Partial | NO | Documented | Partial | LOW |
| **Automated Control System** | NO | NO | Automated | NO | LOW |

### Human Factors Verdict

Grammar design matches **pre-automation expert training materials**:
- Folio ordering shows learning progression (risk increases first→last)
- Aggressive programs buffered by safer neighbors (88% vs 49% random)
- Restart programs exist but not strategically positioned (memorized)
- No outcome indicators in grammar (judgment external)

## Axis 5: Negative Matching (Critical)

### Domains That LOOK Similar But BREAK Under Scrutiny

| Completion signals | 0 endpoint markers | All batch processes |
| Yield measurement | 0 identifier tokens | Production processes |
| Phase transitions | CLASS_C fails | Crystallization, evaporation |
| Single-pass flow | G1 = 93.5% failure | Columns, filters |
| Continuous tuning | 83 discrete programs | PID-controlled systems |

## Positive Alignment Synthesis

### What Fits Well

The grammar is most compatible with processes that are:

1. **Inherently indefinite** — No natural endpoint; operation continues until externally terminated
2. **Circulation-dependent** — Material returns to origin; no single-pass throughput
3. **Damping-reliant** — Physical settling time is a control variable
4. **Hazard-symmetric** — Failure modes are mutual exclusions, not one-way
5. **Expert-operated** — No automation; operator judgment is external
6. **Phase-stable** — No phase transitions during operation

### Real-World Examples Matching This Profile

- **Traditional reflux distillation** (pelican alembic)
- **Continuous circulation conditioning** (maturation loops)
- **Gradual extraction through repeated circulation** (percolation with return)
- **Long-duration equilibration baths**

---

## Discriminators Within Compatible Set

The grammar cannot distinguish between:

| Process Type A | Process Type B | Discriminating Feature |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Extraction | Conditioning | Cumulative vs maintenance |
| Reflux still | Circulation bath | Heat source vs ambient |
| Purification | Maturation | Removal vs transformation |

**SPECULATIVE**: Internal analysis cannot resolve which of these the grammar encodes. All are equally compatible with locked constraints.
