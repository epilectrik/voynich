# Voynich Manuscript Computational Analysis

Systematic computational analysis of the Voynich Manuscript (Beinecke MS 408), a 15th-century codex written in an unknown script.

## Project Status: MODEL FROZEN

This project has reached a stable conclusion. The manuscript encodes an **executable operational control grammar** for a closed-loop physical system, not a natural language or cipher.

- [Project Organization](ORGANIZATION.md) - Directory structure and file guide
- [Results](results/) - Canonical grammar and complete recipe atlas

## Key Findings

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| 49 instruction classes | 9.8x vocabulary compression |
| 83 programs (folios) | 75,248 total instructions |
| 100% grammar coverage | Every token executes |
| 0 translation-eligible zones | PURE_OPERATIONAL verdict |
| Closed-loop circulation system | Physics plausibility: 7/7 tracks pass |

## What This Project Shows

The Voynich Manuscript is likely a **technical operations manual** for a circulatory apparatus (possibly reflux distillation), not a cipher, language, or hoax.

## What This Project Does NOT Claim

- Specific products or materials
- Natural language meanings
- Historical identity of author
- Illustration meanings
