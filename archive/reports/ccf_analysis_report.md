## Test 1: LOCALITY VIOLATION

**Question:** Do label tokens on a given sector exert non-local influence?

**Method:** Compare cross-sector dependency density against null model (within-sector permutation).

**Results:**
- Mean observed cross-sector density: 0.1353
- Mean null density: 0.1353
- Significant deviations (p<0.05): 0/26

**VERDICT:** PASS

**Interpretation:** Sectors operate with local dependencies only. No persistent cross-sector influence detected.

## Test 2: CLASS NOVELTY

**Question:** Do any label tokens form new instruction classes, or are they positional variants of existing classes?

**Method:** Map all CCF tokens to frozen 49-class grammar.

**Results:**
- Total CCF token types: 1630
- Total occurrences: 3057
- Classified to existing classes: 2134 (69.8%)
- Unclassified: 923
- Classes used: 48/49

**VERDICT:** INCONCLUSIVE

**Interpretation:** Mixed classification - partial mapping to existing classes

## Test 3: CIRCULAR EXECUTABILITY

**Question:** Is the circular order executably required, or merely visual bundling?

**Method:** Compare transition legality under original order, rotations, and random reordering.

**Results:**
- Mean original legality: 0.0000
- Mean rotation legality: 0.0000
- Mean random legality: 0.0000
- Rotation-robust: False
- Random-robust: False

**VERDICT:** UNKNOWN

**Interpretation:** N/A

## Test 4: BOUNDARY CLUSTERING

**Question:** Do labels disproportionately occur near hazard boundaries or stability bottlenecks?

**Method:** Measure hazard-node density compared to null model (matched-count random placement).

**Results:**
- Mean observed hazard density: 0.0000
- Mean null density: 0.0000
- Pooled Z-score: 0.00
- Hazard nodes tested: ...

**VERDICT:** UNKNOWN

**Interpretation:** N/A

## Conclusions

1. **Locality:** The circular layout does NOT impose non-local constraints. Each sector operates as an independent linear run.

2. **Class Membership:** Mixed classification - partial mapping to existing classes

3. **Circular Order:** 

4. **Boundary Function:**

## Interpretive Firewall Statement

> All findings describe operational roles, structural functions, and execution constraints only.
> No semantic interpretation (astronomy, months, zodiac, symbols) has been applied.
> Domain nouns have been strictly avoided per pre-registration.
>
> If interpretation pressure arises: "This behavior is unclassifiable at present without violating semantic constraints."
