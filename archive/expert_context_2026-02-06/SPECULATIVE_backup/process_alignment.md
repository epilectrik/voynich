# Process Alignment (Tier 3)

**Status:** SPECULATIVE | **Tier:** 3

---

## Apparatus Candidates

### Best Match: Circulatory Reflux Systems

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Compatibility | CLASS_D = 100% |
| Alternatives | ≤20% |
| Historical representative | Pelican alembic (late 15th c.) |
| Structural homology | 8/8 dimensions match |

### Surviving Candidates

| Apparatus | Compatibility |
|-----------|---------------|
| Reflux Distillation | 1.000 |
| Distillation Column | 0.875 |
| Steam Boiler | 0.833 |

### Eliminated

- Biological homeostasis systems (failed TEST_3: no external operator)

## Process Class Survivors (PCISO)

Three process classes survive structural compatibility:

1. **Circulatory Reflux Distillation**
2. **Volatile Aromatic Extraction**
3. **Circulatory Thermal Conditioning**

Common signature: CLOSED-LOOP CIRCULATORY THERMAL PROCESS CONTROL

## Historical Pattern Alignment

**Status:** SYSTEMATIC_MATCH (2026-01-13)

See [brunschwig_comparison.md](brunschwig_comparison.md) for full 6-axis comparison with primary source quotes.

| Voynich Feature | Historical Match | Alignment |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------|
| 49 instruction classes | Brunschwig's 4 degrees × 10 methods = 40 | STRONG |
| 17 forbidden transitions | "Fourth degree coerces—reject it" | STRONG |
| 89% reversibility | "may happen no more than twice" | STRONG |
| Material-apparatus separation | Three-part disjoint structure | STRONG |
| Sensory hierarchy | Finger test, smell test, thumbnail test | STRONG |
| Expert audience | Brunschwig targets novices (INFORMATIVE MISMATCH) | DIFFERENTIATED |

**Axis Scores:** 4 MATCH, 1 PARTIAL, 1 MISMATCH (informative)

7 STRONG alignments, 4 MODERATE across 12 patterns.

## Craft Interpretation (Phase OLF)

Perfumery as interpretive lens - 5/5 tests PLAUSIBLE:

| Test | Verdict |
|------|---------|
| Token clusters align with smell-change windows? | PLAUSIBLE |
| Tokens encode warning memories? | CRAFT-PLAUSIBLE |
| Tokens support resumption after breaks? | STRONGLY PLAUSIBLE |
| Same roles, different vocabulary across sections? | CRAFT NAMING |
| Absences match perfumery tacit knowledge? | EXACTLY ALIGNED |

## Institutional Compatibility (EXT-6)

**Survivors:** Goldsmith/assayer workshops
- Central Europe 1400-1550
- N. Italy 1400-1470

---

## What This Does NOT Mean

- No specific products identified
- No materials encoded
- Apparatus identification is DISCARDABLE
