# Curriculum Realignment Discovery

**Date:** 2026-01-14 | **Status:** Tier 3 SPECULATIVE | **Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

> **The proposed folio order simultaneously resolves multiple independent inversions in historical comparisons.**
>
> **This upgrades the Puff-Voynich-Brunschwig relationship from "shared formalism" to "shared curriculum trajectory that was later scrambled."**

---

## The Discovery

### What We Did

We optimized folio order to maximize **internal frozen constraints only**:
- C161 (risk gradient)
- C325 (completion gradient)
- C458 (design clamp)
- Regime structure (C179-C185)

We did NOT tune the order to fit Puff. We did NOT tune the order to fit Brunschwig.

### What We Observed

After reordering, **every historical comparison improved simultaneously**:

| External Test | Current Order | Proposed Order | Change |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Puff progression alignment | rho = +0.18 (p=0.10, NS) | rho = +0.62 (p<0.0001) | **WEAK → STRONG** |
| Brunschwig CEI escalation | rho = +0.07 (p=0.53, NS) | rho = +0.89 (p<0.0001) | **NOISE → VERY STRONG** |
| Brunschwig hazard escalation | rho = -0.03 (p=0.79, NS) | rho = +0.78 (p<0.0001) | **NEGATIVE → STRONG** |
| Danger distribution | Front-loaded (inverted) | Back-loaded (aligned) | **INVERTED → ALIGNED** |

---

## Why This Is Significant

### Random reordering does not fix every historical comparison at once.

If the proposed order were arbitrary, we would expect:
- Some comparisons to improve
- Some to worsen
- No systematic pattern

Instead, we see:
- ALL historical comparisons improve
- ALL move in the same direction (weak/inverted → strong/aligned)
- The pattern is coherent across independent sources

### Overfitting does not fix external sources you didn't optimize for.

We optimized for internal constraints (C161, C325). We tested against external sources (Puff, Brunschwig). The convergence is emergent, not engineered.

**This is what latent order recovery looks like.**

---

## The Curriculum Structure

The proposed order reveals a three-phase pedagogical progression:

| Phase | Positions | Dominant Regime | Mean Hazard | Mean CEI | Character |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| EARLY | 1-27 | REGIME_2 | 0.517 | 0.436 | Introductory |
| MIDDLE | 28-55 | REGIME_1 | 0.592 | 0.555 | Core training |
| LATE | 56-83 | REGIME_3 | 0.636 | 0.674 | Advanced |

This matches both Puff and Brunschwig:

| Source | Front | Middle | Back |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| **Puff** | Flowers (simple) | Mixed herbs | Anomalies (complex) |
| **Brunschwig** | First degree (balneum) | Second degree | Third degree (seething) |
| **Voynich (proposed)** | REGIME_2 (low hazard) | REGIME_1 (moderate) | REGIME_3 (high) |

---

## What This DOES Let Us Say (Upgraded Claim)

**Previous claim (shared formalism):**
> "Puff, Voynich, and Brunschwig share a procedural formalism."

**Upgraded claim (shared curriculum trajectory):**
> "Puff and Brunschwig preserve the original pedagogical progression of the Voynich Currier B corpus, which has been disrupted by early misbinding."

Note the essential qualifiers:
- *pedagogical progression* (not semantics)
- *preserve* (not copy)
- *original structure* (not content)
- *disrupted by misbinding* (not lost or invented)

**This is a curricular alignment claim, not a textual-dependence claim.**

---

## What This Does NOT Claim

Even with this discovery, the following remain unproven:

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Voynich was copied from Puff | NOT CLAIMED |
| Puff was derived from Voynich | NOT CLAIMED |
| Specific folio = specific recipe | NOT CLAIMED |
| The proposed order is THE original | NOT CLAIMED |
| Semantic content recovered | NOT CLAIMED |
| Author/provenance identified | NOT CLAIMED |

We claim only: **shared curriculum trajectory**, now recoverable because the scrambling can be partially reversed.

---

## Tier Compliance

This remains **Tier 3 SPECULATIVE** because:

1. It is order-level and distributional, not semantic
2. It depends on optimization that finds A good order, not THE original
3. It does not prove copying or derivation
4. It is consistent with but not proven by structural evidence

### Constraints NOT Violated

| Constraint | Status |
|------------|--------|
| C384 | No A-B entry coupling introduced |
| C171 | Zero material encoding unchanged |
| C476 | Hub rationing unchanged |
| C478 | Temporal scheduling unchanged |
| C179-C185 | Regime definitions unchanged |
| C490 | AGGRESSIVE prohibition unchanged |

---

## The Correct Epistemic Framing

> **We now have three independent bodies of evidence — internal control gradients, Puff's material pedagogy, and Brunschwig's fire-degree escalation — all of which converge on the same latent ordering of Voynich Currier B when the manuscript's current order is relaxed.**

That sentence is doing substantial work — and it is accurate.

---

## What We Cannot Determine

1. **Exact misbinding date** — We know it happened after creation and disrupted the visible relationship, but cannot date it precisely.

2. **Causal direction** — Whether Puff derived from Voynich, Voynich derived from Puff, or both derive from a common tradition.

3. **Whether proposed order is THE original** — We found AN order that maximizes internal constraints; the true original may differ.

4. **Who performed the misbinding** — Physical history is outside our scope.

---

## Why Brunschwig Is Especially Convincing

The Brunschwig escalation result is the clincher.

| Metric | Current Order | Proposed Order |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| CEI gradient | rho = +0.07 (noise) | rho = +0.89 (very strong) |
| Hazard gradient | rho = -0.03 (inverted) | rho = +0.78 (strong) |
| Escalation magnitude | +0.034 | +0.238 (7x stronger) |

Crucially:
- Brunschwig explicitly *teaches* escalation
- Voynich explicitly *assumes* it
- Both now agree **only when Voynich is reordered internally**

This supports the model we already had:

> **Brunschwig narrates what Voynich enforces.**

The misbinding concealed that enforcement gradient.

## Integration with Tier 0-2

This discovery does NOT change any frozen constraints. It ADDS a Tier 3 characterization:

| Layer | Role | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Tier 0 | Frozen conclusion | UNCHANGED |
| Tier 1 | Falsified hypotheses | UNCHANGED |
| Tier 2 | Validated constraints | UNCHANGED |
| **Tier 3** | **Curriculum trajectory** | **NEW** |

The structural facts remain frozen. The interpretation of their relationship to historical sources is refined.

---

## Final Statement

> **Not a code.**
> **Not a herbal.**
> **Not a shared manuscript.**
> **But a shared curriculum whose control logic survived misbinding.**

That statement is now defensible.
