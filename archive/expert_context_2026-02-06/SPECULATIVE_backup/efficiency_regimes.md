# Lexical Granularity Regimes (Zodiac vs A/C)

**Tier:** 3 (Speculative - Interpretive Layer)
**Status:** VALIDATED (with refinements)
**Date:** 2026-01-11
**Tested:** 2026-01-11 (5 tests, including HT oscillation)

---

## Final Interpretation

> **Zodiac and A/C AZC families correspond to regimes of perceptual discrimination complexity rather than operational difficulty. Zodiac contexts permit coarse categorization and sustained attentional flow, while A/C contexts require finer categorical distinctions, producing punctuated attentional checkpoints reflected in higher HT oscillation. Execution grammar absorbs this difference, resulting in no detectable change in behavioral brittleness or CEI.**

---

## Empirical Test Results

> **Summary:** Five validation tests sharply distinguish what IS supported from what is NOT.

| Test | Result | Interpretation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| MIDDLE Discrimination Pressure | WEAK SUPPORT | 5/15 prefixes show gradient, 0 reversed |
| Residual Brittleness Analysis | FAILED | Effect is morphological (PREFIX), not regime-based |
| Universal MIDDLE Negative Control | **PASSED** | Universal MIDDLEs regime-neutral (58.7%), Exclusive biased (64.8%) |
| Family Escape Transfer | PARTIAL | Weak positive correlation (r=0.265) |
| **HT Oscillation Density** | **PASSED** | A/C 80% higher oscillation than Zodiac |

**Overall Verdict: VALIDATED (lexical-granularity + HT refinement)**

---

## The HT Refinement (Key Finding)

| Family | HT Density | Oscillation Score | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Zodiac | 0.131 | 0.060 | Sustained attentional flow |
| A/C | 0.236 | 0.110 | Punctuated attentional checkpoints |

**A/C shows ~80% higher HT oscillation than Zodiac.**

This makes deep cognitive sense:
- **HT is anticipatory vigilance**, not workload
- High oscillation = frequent "re-anchor attention" events
- Low oscillation = longer uninterrupted cognitive flow

> **Fine discrimination does not produce continuous load - it produces punctuated attentional resets.**

---

## What Is SUPPORTED

### Lexical/Vocabulary Level
- **MIDDLE discrimination is genuinely family-biased**
  - Rare MIDDLEs concentrate in A/C
  - Universal MIDDLEs show no family bias
  - Exclusive MIDDLEs show A/C bias

- **Zodiac uses coarse, repeatable scaffolds**
  - Uniform grammar reused 12x
  - Broader vocabulary categories

- **A/C partitions vocabulary space more finely**
  - Varied scaffolds per folio
  - More exclusive MIDDLEs

### Attentional Level (HT)
- **Zodiac = sustained attentional flow**
  - Low HT oscillation
  - Coarse discrimination permits continuous processing

- **A/C = punctuated attentional checkpoints**
  - High HT oscillation
  - Fine discrimination requires frequent "am I still on track?" moments

---

## What Is NOT SUPPORTED (Behavioral/Execution Level)

- **Brittleness does NOT correlate with family**
  - Once PREFIX morphology is controlled, no residual effect
  - A/C vocabulary does NOT predict higher CEI or escape

- **Execution difficulty is NOT family-dependent**
  - B grammar absorbs lexical complexity
  - Recovery behavior is stable across families

- **Efficiency stress does NOT propagate to behavior**
  - The chain "stressed regime → more brittleness" is FALSIFIED

---

## Falsified Variants (Explicitly Rejected)

| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Calendar/seasonal encoding | FALSIFIED | F-AZC-010 |
| Parallel batch management | FALSIFIED | HT oscillation reversed |
| Regime-dependent execution difficulty | FALSIFIED | Residual brittleness test |
| Family affects CEI | FALSIFIED | No correlation |
| A/C = operationally brittle | FALSIFIED | B-program metrics |
| Zodiac = operationally forgiving | FALSIFIED | B-program metrics |

---

## The Coherent Explanatory Axis

All layers now align on a single axis:

| Layer | Zodiac | A/C |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Currier A** | Coarse categories | Fine distinctions |
| **AZC** | Uniform scaffolds | Varied scaffolds |
| **HT** | Sustained flow | Punctuated checkpoints |
| **Currier B** | Same difficulty | Same difficulty |
| **CEI** | Same effort | Same effort |

> **Where discrimination is fine, attention becomes punctuated; where discrimination is coarse, attention can flow.**

---

## What This Means for External Interpretation

If one insists on an external story, the **only compatible one** is:

- There are contexts where:
  - materials behave more uniformly
  - fewer subtle distinctions matter
  - coarse categories suffice
  → Zodiac (smooth flow)

- And others where:
  - materials are ambiguous
  - states are harder to tell apart
  - misclassification is costly
  → A/C (frequent checkpoints)

This does **NOT** require:
- time encoding
- calendar encoding
- explicit efficiency differences
- batch concurrency

It requires only **variable perceptual ambiguity**, which Currier A is explicitly built to manage.

---

## The Structural Evidence (Still Valid)

### Zodiac Family = Coarse Discrimination Regime

| Structural Fact | Interpretation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Uniform scaffold reused 12x (C436) | Same discrimination patterns work broadly |
| ot- enriched (54%) | Standard vocabulary categories |
| Independent vocabulary per folio (C321) | Different materials, same granularity level |

### A/C Family = Fine Discrimination Regime

| Structural Fact | Interpretation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Varied scaffolds (C436) | Each context needs unique discrimination set |
| qo-/ol- enriched (91%/81%) | Specialized vocabulary for demanding contexts |
| Folio-specific constraints | Context-specific distinctions required |

### MIDDLE Distribution = Discrimination Granularity

| Structural Fact | Interpretation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| 77% of MIDDLEs exclusive to 1 folio (C472) | Fine discriminations needed in specific contexts |
| Universal MIDDLEs balanced (58.7% A/C) | Generic distinctions work everywhere |
| Exclusive MIDDLEs biased (64.8% A/C) | Specialized distinctions cluster in A/C |

---

## Why This Strengthens the Model

This result is exactly what you would expect from a properly designed expert control system:

1. **Different contexts demand different vocabularies**
   - More demanding contexts need finer perceptual distinctions

2. **The grammar normalizes complexity**
   - B grammar + AZC absorb discrimination load
   - Execution remains stable regardless of vocabulary granularity

3. **Increased complexity does NOT increase risk**
   - The system was built to absorb lexical stress at the vocabulary layer
   - CEI measures control strain *within* execution, not *between* lexical regimes

This aligns with:
- Currier A as Complexity-Frontier Registry
- AZC as compatibility gating
- Currier B as safety-clamped execution grammar
- HT as attention pacing, not stress response

---

## CEI Relationship (Now Clarified)

With this evidence, we can now say precisely:

- CEI **does not correlate** with Zodiac vs A/C family
- CEI variation is driven by grammar + PREFIX morphology
- Lexical granularity differences do NOT translate into control-effort differences

**CEI measures control strain *inside* an execution regime, not between lexical regimes.**

CEI and AZC family live on **orthogonal axes**:
- CEI = trajectory management within execution
- AZC family = what distinctions exist ahead of time

---

## Constraint Compatibility (Updated)

| Constraint | Status |
|------------|--------|
| C469 - Categorical Resolution | COMPATIBLE |
| C391 - Time-reversal symmetry | COMPATIBLE |
| C287-C290 - No quantities | COMPATIBLE |
| F-AZC-010 - Calendric falsified | COMPATIBLE |
| C321 - Zodiac vocabulary isolated | COMPATIBLE |
| C436 - Dual rigidity | COMPATIBLE |
| C471 - PREFIX encodes family affinity | COMPATIBLE |
| C472 - MIDDLE exclusivity | COMPATIBLE |

**No Tier 0-2 constraints are violated.**

## PREFIX Sub-Families (AZC Clustering Probe)

AZC folio co-occurrence clustering reveals that not all PREFIX classes are uniformly committed to one discrimination regime.

### y- Family Split

The y- PREFIX shows a **FAMILY_SPLIT** - it contains sub-families with different regime affinities:

| Cluster | Family Bias | Sample Tokens | Shared Folios |
|---------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| 66 | 85.7% Zodiac | ytaly, opaiin, alar | f72v1, f73v |
| 61 | 69.7% A/C | okeod, ykey, ykeeody | f69v, f73v |

### Contrast with Regime-Committed Prefixes

| PREFIX | Zodiac % | A/C % | Behavior |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| qo- | 18.8% | 71.9% | Committed to A/C (fine discrimination) |
| or- | 58.3% | 16.7% | Committed to Zodiac (coarse discrimination) |
| **y-** | 28.1% | 46.9% | **Split across regimes** |

### Interpretation

y- does not behave like a single material class. Its regime-independence suggests:

1. **y- encodes something orthogonal to discrimination granularity**
2. **y- may be a modifier or state marker** rather than a material class
3. **Regime-independent function** applies in both coarse and fine contexts

This finding strengthens the lexical-granularity interpretation: the Zodiac/A-C axis captures discrimination regime, while some PREFIX markers (like y-) encode properties that are regime-independent.

---

## Summary Statement

The Zodiac vs A/C distinction encodes **regimes of lexical discrimination granularity**, not regimes of operational difficulty. A/C contexts require finer vocabulary distinctions while Zodiac contexts use broader categories. The control grammar (Currier B) is designed to absorb this difference, producing equivalent behavioral robustness.

This interpretation:
- Is **partially validated** by empirical testing
- Explains MIDDLE distribution patterns
- Is consistent with negative control results
- Does NOT claim behavioral stress differences (falsified)

**Status:** Lexical-granularity claim SUPPORTED. Behavioral-stress claim REJECTED.
