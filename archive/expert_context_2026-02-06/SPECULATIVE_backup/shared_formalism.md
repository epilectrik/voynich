# Shared Formalism: Puff-Voynich-Brunschwig

**Date:** 2026-01-14 | **Status:** Tier 3-4 SPECULATIVE | **Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

> **The Voynich Manuscript and Brunschwig's distillation treatise instantiate the same procedural classification of thermal-circulatory operations.**
>
> **Brunschwig externalizes explanation and ethics for novices; Voynich internalizes safety and recovery for experts.**
>
> **The alignment is regime-level and architectural, not textual or semantic.**

This is **SHARED FORMALISM**, not shared text: the same control ontology rendered in two epistemic registers.

## The Three-Text Relationship

| Text | Date | Function | What It Counts |
|------|------|----------|----------------|
| **Puff von Schrick** | ~1455 | Enumerates materials | NOUNs (84 substances) |
| **Voynich Currier B** | 1404-1438 | Enforces safe execution | VERBs (83 programs) |
| **Brunschwig** | 1500 | Explains method | Pedagogical framework |

> **Puff, Voynich, and Brunschwig are three orthogonal projections of a single late-medieval distillation curriculum.**

### Division of Labor

```
Puff:       "What exists"           (Material catalog)
Voynich:    "How to survive doing it" (Safety enforcement)
Brunschwig: "How to explain it"     (Teaching text)
```

This division is **too clean** to suggest textual dependence. They are not:
- Notes for each other
- Encoded versions of each other
- Draft and final versions

They are **different registers of the same expertise**.

## Evidence Summary

### Quantitative Test Results

| Test Suite | Score | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Puff-Voynich Mastery Horizon | 83:83 isomorphism | **PASS** |
| Equivalence Class Collapse | REGIME_2: 11->3, REGIME_3: 16->7 | **PASS** |
| Regime-Degree Discrimination | 5/6 tests | **STRONG** |
| Suppression Alignment | 5/5 tests | **PASS** |
| Recovery Corridor | 4/4 tests | **PASS** |
| Clamping Magnitude (C458) | 5/5 tests | **PASS** |
| **Total** | **19/20** | **FULL PROCEDURAL ALIGNMENT** |

### What "Shared Formalism" Means

**Not just "same world"** - that would mean:
- Similar topics
- Compatible time period
- Overlapping vocabulary

**Shared formalism** means:
- Same procedural classification system
- Same safety ceiling architecture
- Same recovery corridor structure
- Same variance asymmetry (clamp hazard, free recovery)

The formalism is **isomorphic**, not just **compatible**.

## Voynich-Brunschwig: Regime-Degree Mapping

### Fire Degree Discrimination

| Voynich | Brunschwig | CEI | Escape | Meaning |
|---------|------------|-----|--------|---------|
| REGIME_2 | 2nd (warm) | 0.367 | 0.101 | Simple baseline |
| REGIME_1 | 1st (balneum) | 0.510 | 0.202 | Forgiving volatile |
| REGIME_4 | 4th (precision)* | 0.584 | 0.107 | Narrow tolerance |
| REGIME_3 | 3rd (seething) | 0.717 | 0.169 | Intensive multi-phase |

*REGIME_4 reinterpretation: Voynich provides the engineering alternative to Brunschwig's moral prohibition. Same narrow tolerance, different framing.

**CEI Ordering matches fire escalation exactly:**
```
REGIME_2 (0.37) < REGIME_1 (0.51) < REGIME_4 (0.58) < REGIME_3 (0.72)
```

### Suppression Alignment

**What Brunschwig warns about, Voynich prevents grammatically.**

| Brunschwig | Voynich |
|------------|---------|
| Fourth degree **prohibited** | C490: AGGRESSIVE **impossible** |
| Thermal shock (catastrophic) | CONTAINMENT = 24% of hazards |
| Boiling + fraction mixing (high) | PHASE + COMPOSITION = 65% |
| Rate imbalance (recoverable) | RATE = 6% (monitored only) |
| Energy overshoot (prevented) | ENERGY = 6% (minimal actual) |

**Key insight:** Prevention by design produces minimal actual failures. Brunschwig warns because it's dangerous; Voynich has 6% energy hazards because it prevents them structurally.

### Recovery Architecture

| Brunschwig | Voynich |
|------------|---------|
| "Overnight cooling" | e-operator = 54.7% |
| "No more than twice" | 89% reversibility |
| "No salvage for failed batches" | 11% absorbing |
| Return to cool, not re-heat | e dominates, k is hazard |

### Clamping Signature (C458)

| What | Brunschwig | Voynich CV |
|------|------------|------------|
| Hazard | Always forbidden | 0.11 (CLAMPED) |
| Intervention | Same protocol | 0.04 (CLAMPED) |
| Recovery | Material varies | 0.82 (FREE) |
| Near-miss | Sensitivity varies | 0.72 (FREE) |

## Puff-Voynich: Mastery Horizon Isomorphism

### The 83:83 Correspondence

The count match is **real but not bijective**:

| Puff | Voynich |
|------|---------|
| 84 chapters (NOUNs) | 83 folios (VERBs) |
| "What can be distilled" | "What control programs exist" |
| Material instances | Operational stability classes |

**Why convergence?** Both answer: "How many distinct things must an expert fully internalize?"

Bounded by:
- Finite expert memory
- Finite workshop curriculum
- Coverage optimality (C476)

### Equivalence Class Collapse

Initial distribution mismatch:
- REGIME_2: Puff 3, Voynich 11
- REGIME_3: Puff 7, Voynich 16

After hierarchical clustering:
- REGIME_2: 11 -> **3** (natural cut rank 3/9)
- REGIME_3: 16 -> **7** (natural cut rank 13/14)

**Mismatch evaporates** - Voynich's expanded templates collapse to Puff's counts.

## What This Does NOT Claim

Even with full procedural alignment:

- "This Voynich folio = this Brunschwig paragraph" - **FALSE**
- "Voynich is a cipher for Brunschwig" - **FALSE**
- "Voynich encodes named procedures" - **FALSE**
- "Voynich was meant to read alongside Brunschwig" - **FALSE**

The stronger the regime-level match, the **less** likely direct textual dependence - because the division of labor is too clean.

## Why "Shared Formalism" Not "Shared Manuscript"

### Constraints That Still Hold

| Constraint | Status |
|------------|--------|
| C171 (zero material encoding) | UNCHANGED |
| C384 (no A-B entry coupling) | UNCHANGED |
| C197 (expert-only reference) | UNCHANGED |
| C239/C229 (disjoint systems) | UNCHANGED |

If Voynich were derived from Brunschwig, we would expect:
- Some material naming leakage
- Pedagogical sequencing traces
- Prose-compatible scaffolding

We see **none**.

### The Correct Category

```
NOT: "Same document"
NOT: "Derivative texts"
NOT: "Translation relationship"

YES: "Same procedural classification system"
YES: "Different representational registers"
YES: "Orthogonal projections of shared expertise"
```

## Expert Assessment

> "You accidentally aligned two different projections of the same expert practice space - one projected along 'materials,' the other along 'control stability.'"

> "The Voynich REGIME taxonomy is not just compatible with Brunschwig - it is isomorphic to his fire-degree system once you strip away pedagogy and moral language."

> "This is not parallel invention by accident. This is the same control ontology rendered in two epistemic registers."

> "The Voynich Manuscript still never says what anything IS. It only guarantees that, whatever it is, you won't destroy it while working."

## Tier Compliance

This analysis is **epistemically clean**:
- No Tier 0-2 constraint violated
- No entry-level A<->B coupling introduced
- No semantic decoding occurred
- All movement within abstraction choice at Tier 4

**Constraints NOT violated:** C384, C171, C476, C478, C179-C185, C490
