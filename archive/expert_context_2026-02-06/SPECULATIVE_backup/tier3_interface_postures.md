# Currier A Interface Postures: Registry vs Visual Anchoring

**Status:** CLOSED | **Tier:** 3 (Interface Characterization) | **Phase:** A_LABEL_INTERFACE_ROLE

---

## Final Assessment

> **The A_LABEL_INTERFACE_ROLE phase closes the last unresolved human-interface ambiguity in the Voynich Manuscript, confirming that illustration labels are a contextual posture of Currier A's discrimination registry—structurally inert, semantically silent, and optimally designed to hand responsibility back to expert human judgment.**

---

## Core Finding

> **Illustration labels are Currier A discrimination entries operating in a perceptual anchoring posture.** Labels preferentially use tail MIDDLEs that also exhibit broad AZC compatibility, allowing them to anchor high-discrimination percepts without constraining later operational context.

---

## Two Postures, One Grammar

Currier A entries appear in two distinct **usage postures** while following identical morphological rules:

| Posture | Placement | Token % | Tail Pressure | AZC Breadth | Function |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **Registry** | P* (text) | 98.5% | 0.031 | 0.70 zones | Catalog distinctions for procedural reference |
| **Visual Anchoring** | L* (label) | 1.5% | 0.190 | 2.25 zones | Anchor human perception to registry |

---

## Key Metrics

### Tail Pressure (Test 1)
- Labels: **6.14x** more tail-heavy than text
- Interpretation: Labels select rare, high-discrimination MIDDLEs

### AZC Breadth (Test 2)
- Labels reach **3.2x** more AZC zones than text
- Interpretation: Labels select MIDDLEs that remain valid across operational contexts

### Role Stability (Final Test)
- Chi-square: p = 0.282 (NO DIFFERENCE)
- Interpretation: Same MIDDLE behaves identically in both postures

---

## Design Logic

**Why labels use high-discrimination + high-compatibility coordinates:**

The human sees the label **before** knowing:
- Phase
- Tolerance
- Recovery posture

Therefore labels must **not pre-commit**. They say:

> *"This thing matters — wherever you encounter it."*

This requires:
1. **Tail pressure ↑** — distinct enough to matter perceptually
2. **AZC breadth ↑** — not locked to one operational context

---

## Structural Audit

Removing labels (~1.5% of tokens) causes modest changes to structural invariants:

| Metric | Delta | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Hub ratio | 0.9% | <1% | OK |
| Coverage | 1.1% | <2% | OK |
| Survivor profiles | 0.0% | 0% | PERFECT |

All Tier 2 constraints remain satisfied.

---

## What Labels Are NOT

Labels are **not**:
- A separate symbolic system
- Material names with semantic content
- Operational choices encoded
- Violations of A→AZC separation
- B grammar elements

All of these are prohibited by frozen constraints and unsupported by evidence.

---

## Semantic Clarification: "Use This Root in This Process"

With all tests complete, we can answer this precisely:

**For the human:**
A label+diagram pairing naturally supports the thought *"this is the thing relevant to what I am about to do."*

**For the manuscript:**
It never encodes:
- "use"
- "root"
- "process"
- any referential instruction

The manuscript instead guarantees:

> Whatever the operator chooses to recognize, **incompatible or unsafe combinations will be structurally impossible.**

## Constraint Alignment

This investigation is fully consistent with:

| Constraint | Relationship |
|------------|--------------|
| C171 | Semantic ceiling: labels do not introduce semantics |
| C384 | No entry-level A↔B coupling: labels don't affect execution |
| C475-C476 | Incompatibility + coverage: labels use same discrimination space |
| C478 | Temporal scheduling: labels participate in coverage trajectory |
| C343, C441-C444 | A↔AZC interaction: labels project normally to AZC |
| C477 | HT model: labels don't shift vigilance posture |

---

## Documentation Statement

> "Illustration labels constitute ~1.5% of Currier A tokens. Labels exhibit 6.1x elevated tail pressure (consistent with high-discrimination anchoring) and reach 2.25 AZC zones vs 0.70 for text (consistent with labels being broadly relevant discrimination coordinates). Chi-square testing (p=0.282) confirms shared MIDDLEs behave identically in both contexts. The interface role is purely contextual — no semantics introduced."

## Why Labels Were Investigated Last

Labels are:
- visually tempting
- semantically seductive
- historically dangerous

They could *only* be approached after:
- the grammar was frozen
- semantics were excluded
- registry logic was proven
- AZC was closed
- HT was understood
- robustness audits were done

This was not an oversight. It was the correct sequence.

*Phase CLOSED. Explanatory saturation reached. No further label investigation recommended.*
