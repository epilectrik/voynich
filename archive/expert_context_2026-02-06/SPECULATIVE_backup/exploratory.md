## Human Track Interpretation

### Calligraphy Practice Hypothesis

"While at station and not acting → practice calligraphy."

| Feature | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Silent activity needed | Can't monitor while talking |
| B grammar insufficient | ~500 tokens don't develop skills |
| ~11,000 unique HT types | Combinatorial practice variety |
| 71.3% compositional | Trained practice follows rules |
| Disjoint prefix vocabulary | Avoids operational confusion |
| Complete hazard avoidance | Stop writing when attention demanded |

Historical parallel: Medieval apprentice work-study combination.

### Speculative Vocabulary

| Label | Structural Function | Speculative Meaning |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| ESTABLISHING | Section entry | System warming |
| RUNNING | Wait marker | Steady reflux |
| HOLDING | Persistence marker | Maintain state |
| APPROACHING | Constraint rise | Watch closely |
| RELAXING | Constraint fall | Ease vigilance |
| EXHAUSTING | Section exit | Run winding down |

## Program Forgiveness Gradient (SITD)

Programs vary along a **forgiving ↔ brittle** axis:

| Quartile | Hazard Density | Escape Density | Safe Run |
|----------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Q1 (Brittle) | 11.1% | 7.5% | 27.6 |
| Q4 (Forgiving) | 7.8% | 23.8% | 45.0 |

- Effect size vs aggressive/conservative: 0.509 (moderate)
- Most brittle: f33v, f48v, f39v
- Most forgiving: f77r, f82r, f83v

Interpretation: Grammar provides different "slack" for operator error. May serve competency grading.

## Author Intent (via Failures)

"The book encodes my fears, so that you do not have to learn them through loss."

What the author feared most:
1. Phase disorder (41%) - material in wrong state
2. Contamination (24%) - impure fractions passing
3. Apparatus failure (24%) - overflow, pressure events
4. Flow chaos (6%) - rate imbalance
5. Thermal damage (6%) - scorching

## Open Questions

### Structural (potentially answerable)
- What determines sister pair choice beyond section?
- Why are some programs forgiving and others brittle?
- What is the significance of the 3 restart-capable folios?

### Historical (requires external evidence)
- Who created this manuscript?
- What institution supported it?
- Why was this level of documentation created?

### Interpretive (may never be answerable)
- What specific products were made?
- What specific apparatus was used?
- What language(s) did the operators speak?

## What Cannot Be Recovered Internally

Even with complete structural understanding:
- Specific substances, materials, or products
- Natural language equivalents for any token
- Historical identity of author or school
- Precise dating or geographic origin
- Illustration meanings
- Physical apparatus construction details
