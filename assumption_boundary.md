## Purpose

This document explicitly states what the Physics Plausibility Audit **did** and **did not** test.

---

## What This Audit TESTED

| Property | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| Irreversibility | Grammar does not imply recovery from irrecoverable states |
| Energy conservation | State changes require sustained control input |
| Latency tolerance | Grammar permits delayed system response |
| Noise tolerance | Grammar does not require perfect precision |
| Control dimensionality | Number of control axes is realistic |
| Extended stability | Grammar maintains stability under prolonged operation |
| Failure legibility | Forbidden transitions resemble real failure modes |

All tests evaluated **dynamical consistency only**—whether the grammar's constraints and behaviors are compatible with controlling a real physical system.

---

## What This Audit DID NOT Test

### 1. Specific Physical System

The audit evaluated abstract dynamics, not any specific apparatus:

- Did NOT test compatibility with distillation equipment
- Did NOT test compatibility with chemical reactors
- Did NOT test compatibility with biological systems
- Did NOT identify what physical system the grammar controls

### 2. Material or Substance Identity

The audit is agnostic to what is being processed:

- Did NOT test for specific chemicals
- Did NOT test for biological materials
- Did NOT test for metals, minerals, or organic compounds
- Did NOT identify what enters or exits the system

### 3. Token or Glyph Meanings

The audit treats tokens as opaque control symbols:

- Did NOT assign meanings to any token
- Did NOT translate any sequence
- Did NOT validate proposed decipherments
- Did NOT identify what operators "mean"

### 4. Historical Identity

The audit makes no claims about provenance:

- Did NOT test authorship hypotheses
- Did NOT test dating hypotheses
- Did NOT test geographic origin
- Did NOT test cultural affiliation

### 5. Correctness of Outcomes

The audit tested plausibility, not optimality:

- Did NOT test whether the grammar produces good outcomes
- Did NOT test whether the grammar is efficient
- Did NOT test whether the grammar reflects best practice
- Did NOT test whether an expert would approve the control strategy

### 6. Internal Grammar Validity

The audit accepted the frozen grammar as given:

- Did NOT re-test grammar coverage
- Did NOT re-test instruction classification
- Did NOT re-test convergence analysis
- Did NOT modify any internal finding

---

## What the Verdict MEANS

**PHYSICALLY PLAUSIBLE** means:

> A competent human operator could use this grammar to control a real continuous physical system without violating fundamental physics.

It does NOT mean:

- The grammar is correct
- The grammar is optimal
- The grammar controls a known system
- The grammar encodes useful knowledge
- The grammar was designed by an expert

---

## What the Verdict DOES NOT IMPLY

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| "The Voynich is a real operational manual" | NOT TESTED |
| "The Voynich describes distillation" | NOT TESTED |
| "The Voynich encodes working knowledge" | NOT TESTED |
| "The Voynich author knew physics" | NOT TESTED |
| "The control strategy would work" | NOT TESTED |

---

## Hard Boundaries

1. **No semantic claims.** Tokens remain undefined.
2. **No historical claims.** Provenance remains unknown.
3. **No correctness claims.** Optimality was not evaluated.
4. **No apparatus claims.** Physical system was not identified.
5. **No modification to frozen model.** All internal findings preserved.

---

## Summary

The Physics Plausibility Audit answered exactly one question:

> "Could a competent human operate a real physical system using this grammar without violating physics?"

**Answer: YES**

This does not advance any claim about what the system is, who designed it, or whether it would work. It only establishes that the grammar's constraints are compatible with physical reality.
