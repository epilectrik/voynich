# Currier B Macro-Scaffold Audit: Summary Report

**Status:** COMPLETE | **Result:** NO MACRO-SCAFFOLD REUSE | **4-Layer Model:** UNCHANGED

---

## Core Question

> Does Currier B show evidence of "uniform vs folio-specific rigidity" at a macro-organizational level, analogous to AZC?

## Answer

**No.** Currier B exhibits **continuous adaptive variation** with essentially no macro-scaffold reuse. The cross-folio structural similarity is **0.007** (near-random), which is:

- **135x lower** than AZC-Zodiac (0.945 = uniform scaffold reuse)
- **49x lower** than AZC-A/C (0.340 = folio-specific rigid scaffolds)

This difference is **explanatory, not problematic**. It confirms the architectural distinction between B (adaptive execution) and AZC (context locking).

## Evidence Table

### FOR Macro-Scaffold Reuse

| Evidence | Value | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Cluster separation | 0.735 | Distinct folio groups exist |
| Bootstrap stability | 0.911 | Clustering is statistically real |

### AGAINST Macro-Scaffold Reuse

| Evidence | Value | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Cross-folio similarity | 0.007 | 135x below AZC-Zodiac reference |
| Regime alignment | 0.675 | Clusters capture REGIME, not scaffolds |
| Pattern classification | FOLIO_SPECIFIC | No template reuse detected |

## Quantitative Comparison

| System | Cross-Folio Similarity | Organization Type |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| AZC-Zodiac | 0.945 | Uniform reusable scaffold |
| AZC-A/C | 0.340 | Folio-specific rigid scaffolds |
| **Currier B** | **0.007** | **Continuous adaptive variation** |

The similarity gradient is:

```
UNIFORM ←——————————————————————————————→ ADAPTIVE
  AZC-Z (0.945)   AZC-A/C (0.340)   B (0.007)
```

Currier B is not merely "less uniform" than AZC. It is **qualitatively different** — continuous variation within regime constraints rather than discrete scaffold selection.

## What the Clusters Capture

The 8 optimal clusters identified in B folios show:

- **67.5% regime purity** — clusters largely map to the 4 CEI regimes
- **High stability** (0.911) — the clustering is real, not noise
- **No cross-regime templates** — no evidence of scaffold structures that span regime boundaries

This means: **The structure that exists in B is REGIME structure**, not separate scaffold structure overlaid on top of regimes.

## Architectural Implications

The 4-layer model remains unchanged:

| Layer | System | Organization | This Audit |
|-------|--------|--------------|------------|
| Execution | Currier B | Continuous adaptive variation | **CONFIRMED** |
| Distinction | Currier A | Registry chains | (not tested) |
| Context | AZC | Discrete scaffold selection | (reference) |
| Orientation | HT | Grammar triggers | (not tested) |

The difference between B and AZC is **functional**:

- **AZC** gates entry into constrained contexts (scaffold selection)
- **B** executes procedures within those contexts (adaptive response)

Expecting B to have AZC-like scaffolds would conflate these distinct roles.

## Methodology

**Governance:** Confirmatory audit only. No grammar modification. Tier 2 safe.

**Features used:** 15 locked metrics from existing sources:
- CEI components (time, risk, stability)
- Control signatures (LINK density, hazard density, intervention frequency)
- Kernel metrics (contact ratio, dominance)
- Cycle metrics (regularity, mean length)
- qo- prefix density

**Clustering:** Hierarchical (Ward linkage), bootstrap stability tested (100 subsamples).

**Comparison:** Jensen-Shannon divergence, cosine similarity.

## Conclusion

Currier B does **not** exhibit macro-scaffold organization analogous to AZC. The observed folio clustering reflects **regime-based variation**, not discrete template selection.

This result **strengthens** the existing 4-layer architectural model by confirming that B's organizational principle (adaptive execution) is qualitatively distinct from AZC's (context locking).

No modifications to the frozen model are required or suggested.
