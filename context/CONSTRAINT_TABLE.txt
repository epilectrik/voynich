C281	Components SHARED across A and B	2	A↔B	in: morphology
C281	Components SHARED	2	A	in: currier_a
C282	Component ENRICHMENT: CT is A-enriched (0.14x), OL/QO are B-enriched (5x/4x); -dy suffix 27x B-enriched, -or 0.45x A-enriched; usage patterns differ dramatically (EXT-8)	2	A	in: currier_a
C283	Suffixes show CONTEXT PREFERENCE: -or (0.67x), -chy (0.61x), -chor (0.18x) A-enriched; -edy (191x!), -dy (4.6x), -ar (3.2x) B-enriched; -ol, -aiin BALANCED (EXT-9)	2	A	in: currier_a
C284	CT in B is CONCENTRATED in specific folios (48 folios); when CT appears in B it uses B-suffixes (-edy, -dy); registry materials take operational form in procedures (EXT-9)	2	A	in: currier_a

C290	Same composition with different counts confirms count is INSTANCE MULTIPLICITY, not magnitude; "3x here" is not comparable to "3x there" due to section isolation (EXT-9B RETRACTION)	2	A	in: currier_a
C291	~20% have optional ARTICULATOR forms	2	A	in: morphology
C291	~20% of Currier A tokens have OPTIONAL ARTICULATOR forms (yk-, yt-, kch-, etc.); MORE section-concentrated than core prefixes; 100% removable without identity loss; systematic refinement layer, not noise (EXT-9B)	2	A	in: currier_a
C292	Articulators = ZERO unique identity distinctions	2	A	in: morphology
C292	Articulators contribute ZERO unique identity distinctions; ablation creates 0 collisions; purely EXPRESSIVE, not discriminative (CAS-POST)	2	A	in: currier_a
C293	Component essentiality hierarchy: MIDDLE (402 distinctions) > SUFFIX (13) > ARTICULATOR (0); PREFIX provides foundation (1387 base); MIDDLE is primary discriminator (CAS-POST)	2	A	in: currier_a
C294	Articulator density INVERSELY correlates with prefix count (15% at 0-1 prefix to 4% at 6 prefixes); articulators COMPENSATE for low complexity (CAS-POST)	2	A	in: currier_a
C295	Sections exhibit DISTINCT configurations: H=dense mixed (87% mixed, 8.2% art), P=balanced (48% exclusive, 5.1% art), T=uniform sparse (81% uniform, 2.57x mean rep) (CAS-POST)	2	A	in: currier_a
C296	CH appears in nearly all common prefix pairs (CH+DA, CH+QO, CH+SH); functions as UNIVERSAL MIXING ANCHOR (CAS-POST)	2	A	in: currier_a
C297	-eol is ONLY suffix concentrated in section P (55.9% vs 41.3% H); all other suffixes favor H; P has distinct suffix profile (CAS-POST)	2	A	in: currier_a
C298	L-compound middle patterns (lch-, lk-, lsh-) function as B-specific grammatical operators; 30-135x more common in B, largely absent from A; grammar-level specialization not covered by shared component inventory (B-MORPH)	2	A	in: currier_a
C299	Section H vocabulary dominates B procedures (76/83 = 91.6%); Section P rare (7/83 = 8.4%); Section T absent (0/83 = 0%); chi² = 127.54, p < 0.0001; A sections have NON-UNIFORM mapping to B procedure applicability (CAS-XREF)	2	A	in: currier_a
