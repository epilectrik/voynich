# ANALYSIS NOTES
# ============================================================
analysis_notes: |
  Key observations:
  1. Maximum judgment load (13/13) - this is an expert-level procedure
  2. All kernel operators engaged (k, h, e)
  3. 4/5 hazard classes exposed - high-risk procedure
  4. Smell is dominant modality but UNMAPPED in Voynich constraints
  5. Two-stage structure has no direct Voynich correlate
  6. High registry-internal vocabulary prediction (70%)

  Triangulation should yield:
  - REGIME_4 folios (25 total)
  - R-zone enriched MIDDLEs
  - P-zone enriched MIDDLEs
  - Low escape architecture
  - ch-prefix dominant (precision)

  Confidence: HIGH for regime mapping, MODERATE for zone affinity,
  LOW for specific vocabulary prediction.
