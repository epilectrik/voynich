  smell:
    required: true
    indicators: ["characteristic odor change", "sulfur notes", "completion smell"]
    evidence: "Animal materials have distinctive odor progression during distillation"

# DERIVED VOYNICH CONSTRAINTS

derived_constraints:
  regime_mapping:
    target_regime: "REGIME_4"
    confidence: "high"
    notes: "4th degree fire maps directly to REGIME_4 per C494"

  zone_affinity:
    r_zone_expected: true       # Sound monitoring (bubbling)
    p_zone_expected: true       # Sight monitoring (vapor, clarity)
    s_zone_expected: false
    confidence: "medium"
    notes: "Sound and sight both required; smell is unmapped gap"

  execution_profile:
    escape_expected: "low"
    recovery_latitude: "constrained"
    notes: "Precision process = low escape (0.52x for REGIME_4 per C443)"

  registry_filter:
    material_class: "animal"
    ri_token_expected: true
    prefix_enrichment: ["da", "ok", "ct"]
    notes: "REGIME_4 shows da/ok/ct PREFIX enrichment; animal class constrains RI tokens"

# TRIANGULATION VECTOR

  regime: 4
  zone_r: true
  zone_p: true
  zone_s: false
  material_class: "animal"
  precision_level: "high"

analysis_notes: |
  Key uncertainties:
  1. Smell monitoring is required but UNMAPPED - this is information loss
  2. 2-stage structure has no Voynich correlate
  3. Need to verify actual Brunschwig quotes for sound/sight evidence

  Triangulation should use:
  - REGIME_4 (25 folios)
  - R-zone enriched MIDDLEs (sound)
  - P-zone enriched MIDDLEs (sight)
  - Animal-class RI tokens
  - Low escape architecture
