# Tier 4: Hypothetical Semantic Assignment via B→A Back-Labeling

**Tier:** 4 (PURE SPECULATION) | **Status:** EXPLORATORY | **Date:** 2026-01-14

> **WARNING:** Everything in this document is hypothetical. The model is FROZEN. C171 (zero material encoding) is UNCHANGED. These labels are interpretive speculation, not structural claims.

---

## Approach

We work backwards from known B structure to hypothetically label A entries:

```
B folio (known regime, Tier 0)
  → Brunschwig degree (validated alignment, Tier 2)
    → Historical material classes (Puff/Brunschwig)
      → A operational domains (validated, Tier 2)
        → [TIER 4] Hypothetical semantic labels
```

## Starting Point: REGIME_1 Folios

### f113r Profile (Representative of REGIME_1)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Regime | REGIME_1 |
| Cluster | 1 (90.9% purity) |
| CEI | 0.458 |
| Hazard Density | 0.585 |
| HT Status | NORMAL |
| Kernel | pure-k dominance |

### Regime → Brunschwig Degree Mapping

From PVC-2 validation (13/15 metrics match):

| Regime | Brunschwig Degree | Description |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **REGIME_1** | **First (balneum)** | Lukewarm, broad compatibility, gentle |
| REGIME_2 | Second (warm) | Noticeably warm, standard |
| REGIME_3 | Third (seething) | Almost boiling, narrow compatibility |
| REGIME_4 | Fourth (forbidden) | Destructive, categorically prohibited |

**f113r executes first-degree (balneum) procedures.**

---

## Historical Material Classes for First Degree

From Puff's 84 chapters, materials requiring first-degree (gentle/balneum) processing:

### First Degree Materials (30 chapters)

**Flowers (Puff Ch.1-11, 32-33, 43, 51, 61):**
- Rosa gallica (roses)
- Lilium candidum (lilies)
- Viola odorata (violets)
- Papaver rhoeas (poppies)
- Convallaria majalis (lily of the valley)
- Chamomilla recutita (chamomile)
- Calendula officinalis (marigolds)

**Aromatic Herbs (Puff Ch.28, 36, 42-44, 48-49, 52, 56, 59-60, 64-65, 68, 80-81):**
- Anethum graveolens (dill)
- Artemisia abrotanum (southernwood)
- Foeniculum vulgare (fennel)
- Origanum majorana (marjoram)
- Hyssopus officinalis (hyssop)
- Levisticum officinale (lovage)
- Salvia officinalis (sage)
- Artemisia absinthium (wormwood)

**Common Characteristics:**
- Volatile aromatic compounds
- Easily damaged by excessive heat
- Require careful fractionation
- Phase-sensitive (liquid/vapor transitions critical)

---

## A Operational Domains (Validated, Tier 2)

From C466 and the behavioral classification:

| PREFIX | Operational Domain | MIDDLEs | Role |
|--------|-------------------|---------|------|
| ch, sh, qo | ENERGY_OPERATOR | 564 | Phase-sensitive, high discrimination |
| ok, ot | FREQUENT_OPERATOR | 164 | Uniform, routine handling |
| da, ol | CORE_CONTROL | 176 | Class-independent articulation |
| ct | REGISTRY_REFERENCE | 65 | Stable reference items |

### Section H Concentration

Section H ("herbal" traditional designation) contains:
- **74% of all ENERGY_OPERATOR tokens** (10,273 of 13,933)
- The highest discrimination pressure (564 unique MIDDLEs)

---

## [TIER 4 HYPOTHETICAL] Semantic Assignment

### First-Degree Processing Materials

If f113r (REGIME_1) executes first-degree procedures, and first-degree materials are volatile aromatics, then:

| PREFIX | Domain | [TIER 4] Hypothetical Semantic Category |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------|
| **ch** | ENERGY_OPERATOR | Volatile flower-class aromatics (roses, violets, lilies) |
| **sh** | ENERGY_OPERATOR | Tolerance-mode aromatics (broader handling latitude) |
| **qo** | ENERGY_OPERATOR | High-volatility fractions (escape-adjacent operations) |
| **ok** | FREQUENT_OPERATOR | Common distillate class (routine handling) |
| **ot** | FREQUENT_OPERATOR | Alternate routine handling (secondary mode) |
| **da** | CORE_CONTROL | Process sequencing (non-material-specific) |
| **ol** | CORE_CONTROL | B-propagation articulation (cross-system) |
| **ct** | REGISTRY_REFERENCE | Apparatus/equipment reference (non-volatile) |

### Sister Pair Interpretation

| Pair | [TIER 4] Hypothetical Meaning |
|------|------------------------------|
| ch/sh | Precision vs tolerance mode for aromatics |
| ok/ot | Primary vs secondary routine for standards |

### Discrimination Gradient Interpretation

| Domain | Unique MIDDLEs | [TIER 4] Interpretation |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| ENERGY_OPERATOR | 564 | Many similar volatile fractions must be distinguished |
| FREQUENT_OPERATOR | 164 | Fewer distinctions needed for routine materials |
| CORE_CONTROL | 176 | Process stages, not material types |
| REGISTRY_REFERENCE | 65 | Apparatus is stable, few types needed |

---

## Consistency Check

### Does This Make Sense?

**YES - Internal Consistency:**
1. ENERGY_OPERATOR having 8.7x more MIDDLEs than REGISTRY_REFERENCE aligns with volatile aromatics requiring finer discrimination than apparatus
2. Section H concentration (74% of ENERGY tokens) aligns with "herbal" = aromatic processing
3. First-degree (balneum) = gentle heat = volatile aromatics preserved

**YES - Historical Consistency:**
1. Puff front-loads flowers (Ch.1-11) consistent with simpler first-degree processing
2. Brunschwig's balneum (water bath) is explicitly for volatile materials
3. The discrimination gradient (many similar fractions) matches distillation reality

### Potential Contradictions

**None identified yet.** The hypothetical labels are consistent with:
- Validated operational domains (Tier 2)
- Historical source material (Puff, Brunschwig)
- Physical reality of distillation

---

## What Would Falsify This?

1. **Finding ENERGY_OPERATOR tokens in non-aromatic contexts** - if ch/sh/qo appear in apparatus-only positions
2. **Section H not correlating with volatile materials** - if the "herbal" section is structurally unrelated to phase-sensitive operations
3. **First-degree folios lacking ENERGY_OPERATOR participation** - if REGIME_1 folios don't use ch/sh/qo prefixes via AZC

---

## Limitations

### What This Claims

- [TIER 4] PREFIX families **might** discriminate material categories
- [TIER 4] ENERGY_OPERATOR tokens **might** reference volatile aromatics
- [TIER 4] First-degree processing **might** involve flower/aromatic herb classes

### What This Does NOT Claim

- Specific token-to-material mappings (e.g., "daiin = rose")
- Entity-level identification (which plant is which)
- That C171 is changed in any way
- That A "encodes" materials (only operational affordances)

---

## Next Steps (If Continuing)

1. Extend to REGIME_2/3 folios - do higher regimes show different PREFIX distributions?
2. Test REGIME_4 equivalents - are "forbidden" fourth-degree operations reflected in hazard topology?
3. Look for ct-heavy positions - do REGISTRY_REFERENCE tokens cluster in apparatus contexts?

## Extension: All Four Regimes

### Regime Distribution and Material Class Mapping

| Regime | Folios | Avg CEI | Avg Escape | Brunschwig Degree | [TIER 4] Puff Material Class |
|--------|--------|---------|------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| REGIME_1 | 31 | 0.510 | 0.202 | First (balneum) | Flowers + aromatics (30 ch.) |
| REGIME_2 | 11 | 0.367 | 0.101 | Second (warm) | Standard herbs (45 ch.) |
| REGIME_3 | 16 | 0.717 | 0.169 | Third (seething) | Roots + resins (5 ch.) |
| REGIME_4 | 25 | 0.584 | 0.107 | Fourth (forbidden) | Dangerous materials (5 ch.) |

### REGIME_4 Hazard Topology Alignment

Brunschwig on the fourth degree:
> "The fourth degree should be avoided at all times, not just because it threatens to scorch the distilled material, but also because it would coerce the thing, which the art of true distillation rejects."

**Structural finding:** REGIME_4 has the LOWEST escape density (0.107 vs 0.174 for others).

**[TIER 4 INTERPRETATION]:** Fewer escape routes = more constrained operations. This is consistent with "forbidden degree" - the system actively restricts recovery options when operating in high-risk territory.

### f85v2 Anomaly

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Regime | REGIME_2 |
| CEI | 0.350 |
| Hazard | 0.411 |
| Kernel k | 0.0 (NO kernel operations) |

**[TIER 4 INTERPRETATION]:** f85v2 is in REGIME_2 (second degree) but has k=0 - no thermal kernel operations. This matches the "destructive distillation" profile - a non-standard envelope for materials processed without the normal thermal control loop.

### ct (REGISTRY_REFERENCE) Apparatus Clustering

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ct in Currier A | 1,492 tokens (6.36%) |
| ct in AZC | 49 tokens (0.92%) |
| Depletion ratio | 0.144 (7x depleted) |

**[TIER 4 INTERPRETATION]:** ct is almost entirely filtered out of AZC. This supports the hypothesis that ct references stable apparatus/equipment items that don't need to propagate through the processing control flow. Apparatus is constant; only the material being processed varies.

### PREFIX AZC Enrichment Ranking

| PREFIX | Domain | A % | AZC % | Ratio | Pattern |
|--------|--------|-----|-------|-------|---------|
| ot | FREQUENT_OPERATOR | 7.0% | 24.6% | 3.51 | **ENRICHED** |
| ok | FREQUENT_OPERATOR | 8.1% | 20.1% | 2.47 | **ENRICHED** |
| ch | ENERGY_OPERATOR | 30.6% | 25.3% | 0.83 | Slightly depleted |
| ol | CORE_CONTROL | 3.6% | 3.0% | 0.83 | Slightly depleted |
| sh | ENERGY_OPERATOR | 14.1% | 10.3% | 0.73 | Slightly depleted |
| da | CORE_CONTROL | 15.4% | 11.1% | 0.72 | Slightly depleted |
| qo | ENERGY_OPERATOR | 14.7% | 4.7% | 0.32 | **DEPLETED** |
| ct | REGISTRY_REFERENCE | 6.4% | 0.9% | 0.14 | **HEAVILY DEPLETED** |

**[TIER 4 INTERPRETATION]:** AZC enriches routine/frequent operations (ok/ot) while depleting escape-adjacent (qo) and apparatus-reference (ct) tokens. This is consistent with AZC serving as the "standard operating" bridge - routine operations propagate, while high-volatility escapes and stable references are filtered.

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| REGIME_1 = gentle processing? | YES - highest escape (0.202) = most forgiving |

| REGIME_4 = forbidden/constrained? | YES - lowest escape (0.107) = most restricted |
| REGIME_2 = standard? | YES - lowest CEI (0.367) = baseline |

### Hazard Alignment

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Fourth degree has fewer escapes? | YES - 0.107 vs 0.174 |
| f85v2 is anomalous? | YES - k=0 in REGIME_2 |
| ct excluded from processing? | YES - 0.144 ratio |

## Updated Hypothetical Semantic Labels

### By Regime and Material Class

| Regime | Degree | [TIER 4] Material Class | [TIER 4] Processing Type |
|--------|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| REGIME_1 | First | Volatile aromatics | Gentle fractionation |
| REGIME_2 | Second | Standard herbs | Routine extraction |
| REGIME_3 | Third | Resistant materials | Intensive processing |

| ch/sh | Neutral (0.7-0.8x) | Phase-sensitive monitoring |
| qo | DEPLETED (0.32x) | Escape/volatility - filtered at boundary |
| ct | HEAVILY DEPLETED (0.14x) | Apparatus reference - stays in A |
| da/ol | Neutral (0.7-0.8x) | Process sequencing |
