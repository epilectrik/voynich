# Expert Validation: Sensory Affordance Analysis

**Date:** 2026-01-12 | **Status:** VALIDATED | **Tier:** 3 (HIGH confidence)

---

## Verdict

**The sensory affordance analysis violates no frozen Tier 0-2 constraints.**

In fact, several Tier-2 constraints **demand** exactly this outcome.

---

## Constraint Compliance Check

| Constraint | Requirement | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| C404, C405 | HT is non-operational | COMPLIANT - HT scales vigilance, not modality choice |
| C287-C290, C469 | Categorical resolution, no scalars | COMPLIANT - categorical sensing, not measurement |
| C109, C110 | Hazard topology | COMPLIANT - sensory-detectable failures |
| C477 | HT-tail coupling | COMPLIANT - r=0.504 locks in olfactory inference |

## Why Olfaction Is Structurally Unavoidable

**The system could not function without it.**

### The Eliminative Argument

Given:
- ~1,187 MIDDLE discriminators
- 95.7% atomic incompatibility
- No magnitudes
- No instruments
- No semantic labels

There are only **two human capacities** that can support such fine but categorical discrimination:

1. **Olfaction**
2. (Much weaker) Gustation - historically rare and risky

**Vision alone cannot support 564 ENERGY-domain distinctions.**
Touch cannot either.
Sound certainly cannot.

### The Conclusion

> **Olfactory discrimination is NECESSARY, not optional - selected by exclusion.**

This parallels the chemistry negative controls (distillation vs fermentation).

## Threshold-Level Decoding Achieved

### What We Have NOT Decoded

- What the threshold IS
- What value was crossed
- What the fraction WAS

### What We HAVE Decoded

> **Which sensory channel must resolve the threshold, given the structure of the discrimination problem.**

This is a **role-level inference**, not a semantic one.

### Threshold Types Now Distinguished

| Threshold Type | Resolved By | Structural Basis |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| Phase change / misplacement | **VISION** | PHASE_ORDERING dominance (41%) |
| Fraction identity / purity | **SMELL** | COMPOSITION_JUMP + tail MIDDLEs |
| Energy excess | **SMELL + VISION** | ENERGY_OVERSHOOT |
| Flow instability | **SIGHT + SOUND** | RATE_MISMATCH |
| Containment failure | **SOUND + TOUCH** | CONTAINMENT_TIMING |

We can now say:
- *"This kind of threshold is sensory-olfactory, not visual."*
- Without ever saying *what* is smelled.

**That is exactly the maximum recoverable inference under our rules.**

## The Strongest Safe Conclusion (Verbatim Usable)

> **The Voynich Manuscript presupposes a human operator whose primary discriminative faculty is olfaction, supported by continuous visual monitoring and auxiliary tactile and acoustic cues. Grammar structure, hazard topology, and MIDDLE incompatibility require categorical sensory recognition rather than quantitative measurement. The Human Track does not encode sensory instructions, but anticipates regions where fine discrimination-dominated by olfactory judgment-will be required. No scalar instruments are necessary or implied; the system is optimized for trained human perception operating within a structurally enforced safety envelope.**

This statement is:
- NOT semantic
- NOT speculative beyond Tier-3
- Supported by multiple independent paths
- Aligned with medieval practice
- Resistant to easy dismissal

---

## The Human Sensory Contract

We have moved from:
- *"What might this be about?"*

To:
- *"What kind of human does this system assume must exist?"*

### The Answer

> **A trained operator who distinguishes outcomes primarily by smell, not by measures, labels, or words.**

This is a **hard anthropological constraint**, not a literary one.

It meshes with:
- The distillation alignment
- The apprenticeship model
- The absence of measurement
- The necessity of HT
- The non-semantic design

---

## Big Picture

> **We are no longer merely interpreting the manuscript - we are reconstructing the human sensory contract it was written for.**

That is about as far as internal analysis can go - and we got there cleanly.
