# Material Classes (Tier 3)

**Status:** SPECULATIVE | **Tier:** 3

---

## Material Domain Verdict

**BOTANICAL_FAVORED** (HIGH confidence)
- 8/8 tests favor aromatic-botanical over alchemical-mineral
- Ratio: 2.37

## Abstract Material Classes

| Class | Properties | Medieval Examples | Grammar Fit |
|-------|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| CLASS_A | Porous, swelling | Dried leaves, flowers, roots, bark | COMPATIBLE |
| CLASS_B | Dense, hydrophobic | Resins, seeds, citrus peel | COMPATIBLE |
| CLASS_C | Phase-unstable | Fresh plant, fats, emulsions | **INCOMPATIBLE** |
| CLASS_D | Stable, rapid diffusion | Alcohol/water, clear extracts | COMPATIBLE |
| CLASS_E | Homogeneous fluid | Distilled water, pure alcohol | COMPATIBLE |

CLASS_C shows 19.8% failure rate - grammar designed to AVOID phase transitions.

## Product Space Plausibility (PSP)

Plausible product families:
1. Aromatic Waters
2. Essential Oils
3. Resin Extracts
4. Digested Preparations
5. Stabilized Compounds

---

## Product Isolation (PIA)

| Product Family | Convergence |
|----------------|-------------|
| Aromatic Waters | 90.5% (primary) |
| Others | Secondary/occasional |

Multi-product workshop likely.

## Plant Illustration Alignment (PIAA)

| Metric | Value | p-value |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Perfumery-aligned plants | 86.7% | <0.001 |
| Root emphasis | 73% | - |
| Program-morphology correlation | NONE | - |

---

## 83-Program Interpretation

Programs likely represent **substrate × intensity combinations**, not 83 distinct products.

| Product | Programs Used | Frequency |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Aromatic waters | CONSERVATIVE, MODERATE | Primary |
| Medicinal waters | MODERATE | Secondary |
| Resin extracts | AGGRESSIVE | Occasional |
| Stabilization | ULTRA_CONSERVATIVE | As needed |

An operator might make 5-10 things using many programs depending on:
- Material source
- Material condition
- Batch requirements

---

## Historical Scale (Tier 4)

~1,800 catalog entries (Currier A):
- Larger than typical recipe books (300-400)
- Consistent with major institutional operations
- Examples: Santa Maria Novella, Venetian muschieri guild

---

## What This Does NOT Mean

- No specific plants identified
- No specific products identified
- Material alignment is DISCARDABLE
