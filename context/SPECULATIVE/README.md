## How to Use This Content

1. **Never cite as fact** - Always qualify as speculative
2. **Never extend without new evidence** - Don't build on speculation
3. **Treat as discardable** - If structural evidence contradicts, discard interpretation
4. **Use for orientation only** - Helps understand what the artifact MIGHT be for
