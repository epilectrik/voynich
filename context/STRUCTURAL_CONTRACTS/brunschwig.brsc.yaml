# ACTION TAXONOMY (Complete)

#
# Audit: 2026-02-06, manual review of sources/brunschwig_1500_text.txt
# Prior extraction (v1.0) captured only PREPARATION actions.
# This taxonomy covers ALL procedural operations across all phases.
#
# IMPORTANT: Brunschwig's text separates GENERAL PROTOCOLS (Book 1,
# chapters V-XXIII) from INDIVIDUAL RECIPES (Book 2). General
# protocols describe mid-process operations (temperature control,
# filtering, sealing, fermentation, rectification) that apply to
# ALL recipes based on fire degree and material type. Individual
# recipes typically specify only preparation steps (GATHER, CHOP,
# DISTILL) because the mid-process operations are understood from
# the general protocols. The v1.0 extraction only read the recipes,
# missing the entire mid-process vocabulary from Book 1.

    name: "Mid-Process Operations"
    location: "Book 1 ch. XI-XVII (general protocols)"
    notes: |
      COMPLETELY ABSENT from v1.0 taxonomy.
      These are the GENERAL PROTOCOLS from Book 1 that apply
      to all recipes. Individual recipes don't repeat them.
      This is why the v1.0 recipe-only extraction missed them.
    actions:

      - action: "LUTE_THERMAL"
        german: ["verlotiert", "verloͤtiert", "verlutiert über dz halb teil"]
        english: "Apply clay coating to lower half of vessel for thermal protection"
        occurrences: "9+ (verlotiert/verlutiert)"
        applies_to: "Ash bath, sand bath, direct fire"
        NOT_required_for: "Balneum marie"

          hab. Aber die in balneũ marie dürffent nit verlottiert sin."
          (line 1345-1351)
        translation: |
          "It is necessary that you lute the glasses over the half part with the
          aforementioned clay or lutum as I taught you in the fifth chapter.
          But those in balneum marie do NOT need to be luted."
        purpose: "Prevents glass from cracking under direct/conducted heat"
        recipe_for_lutum: |
          Lutum sapientie (ch. V, line 945-968):
          Cleaned clay + 2 parts horse dung + brick powder + iron filings
          + unslaked lime + gypite, mixed with salted water + egg white.
        notes: |
          The luting is THERMAL INSULATION, not vapor sealing.
          Balneum marie's water bath provides gentle even heat that
          won't crack glass, so this step is explicitly skipped.

      - action: "LUTE_JOINTS"
        german: ["verlutiert die zwei gleser vff einand", "verlutt er das wol dar vff"]
        english: "Seal joints between apparatus parts with clay to prevent vapor escape"
        occurrences: "Multiple (general protocol)"

          "verlutiert die zwei gleser vff einand dz kein ohtem dar vß gang"

        translation: "Lute the two glasses together so no breath/vapor escapes"
        applies_to: "All distillation methods (alembic on cucurbit)"
        purpose: "Prevent vapor loss at glass-to-glass joints"
        notes: |
          DISTINCT from thermal luting. This seals the alembic head
          onto the cucurbit. Uses the same lutum compound but for
          a different purpose: vapor containment, not heat protection.
          THIS IS WHY STIRRING DOESN'T EXIST: vessel is sealed.

      - action: "PLUG"
        german: ["verſtopfft", "wol verſtopfft mit em zapffen"]
        english: "Plug opening with wooden stopper"
        occurrences: "Many (both mid-process and storage)"

          - "wol verſtopfft mit em zapffen (well stopped with a plug) - line 1738"
          - "verſtopff das wynt od lufftloch (stop the air/vent hole) - line 2043"

          fire_regulation: "Plug/unplug air vents to control heat intensity"
          storage: "Plug vessel for long-term storage"
        notes: |
          verstopffen is the MOST COMMON sealing word in Brunschwig.
          It means plugging/stopping an opening, NOT luting with clay.
          Used for wooden stoppers (zapffen) in vessel mouths AND
          for controlling fire via air vent holes in the furnace.

      - action: "COVER"
        german: ["vermacht", "verdeckt", "zudecken"]
        english: "Close/cover vessel (general closure)"

          - "wol vermacht (well closed) - line 524"
          - "wol verdeckt (well covered) - line 13252"
          - "ein deckel (a lid) - line 1937"
        notes: |
          General closure term. Less specific than verlutiert or
          verstopfft. Often combined: "wol verstopfft vnd vermacht"
          (well plugged and closed). Likely corresponds to putting
          a lid or cover on a vessel.

  # PHASE SUMMARY
  # --------------------------------------------------------
  phase_summary:
    total_actions: 36
    by_phase:
      collection: 3
      preparation: 12
      pretreatment: 5
      distillation: 2
      midprocess: 9   # LUTE_THERMAL, LUTE_JOINTS, PLUG, COVER, REGULATE, MONITOR_DRIPS, MONITOR_TEMP, REPLENISH, COOL
      postprocess: 7
      storage: 4
    v1_coverage: "12 of 36 (33%)"
    v1_gap: |
      v1.0 captured only preparation + distill.
      Completely missed: pretreatment (MACERATE, DRY, FERMENT, MIX),
      mid-process (LUTE_THERMAL, LUTE_JOINTS, PLUG, COVER, REGULATE, MONITOR, COOL),
      post-process (STRAIN, FILTER, RECTIFY, SETTLE),
      and storage (SEAL_VESSEL, LABEL, RENEW).
    v2_seal_correction: |
      v2.0 had a single SEAL action conflating four distinct operations.
      v2.1 splits into LUTE_THERMAL (heat protection), LUTE_JOINTS
      (vapor containment), PLUG (stoppers/vents), COVER (lids).
      Brunschwig uses different German vocabulary for each.
      CRITICAL: Luting is NOT required for balneum marie (explicit in text).

  # --------------------------------------------------------
  # CRITICAL ABSENCE: STIR
  # --------------------------------------------------------
  absent_stir:
    searched_terms: ["rüren", "rueren", "umbrüren"]
    occurrences: "0 (zero genuine stirring references)"
    explanation: |
      Stirring is genuinely absent from Brunschwig because
      distillation is a SEALED VESSEL process. The alembic head
      is luted onto the cucurbit (LUTE_JOINTS) before heating.
      There is no access to the contents during distillation.
      Temperature is controlled entirely from the outside
      (fire regulation via air vents, PLUG/unplug vent holes).
      Quality is judged by observing the output (drip rate,
      not internal inspection).
      This absence is NOT an extraction gap — it is a real
      feature of distillation practice.

  # --------------------------------------------------------
  # ITERATIVE LOOP STRUCTURE
  # --------------------------------------------------------
  iterative_structure:
    description: |
      Brunschwig's highest-quality protocols are explicitly iterative:
      POUR distillate back over fresh herbs → MACERATE → REDISTILL.
      This cycle is repeated 3x (standard) or up to 9x (best quality).
    quote: "ye offter dz gſchicht ye edler das waſſer würt"
    translation: "The more often this happens, the nobler the water becomes"
    max_iterations: 9
    standard_iterations: 3
    voynich_mapping_hypothesis: |
      Maps to suffix control-flow semantics (C171):
      -aiin/-ain = CHECKPOINT (end of cycle, test quality)
      -iin = ITERATE (continue loop)
      -hy = VERIFY (quality check)
      The sealed-vessel + iterative-loop structure matches
      the Voynich grammar's control-flow architecture.

      key_finding: |
        v2.0 conflated four distinct sealing operations under one SEAL action.
        OCR source reveals Brunschwig uses different German vocabulary for:
        1. LUTE_THERMAL (verlotiert über dz halb teil): clay coating on vessel
           bottom for heat protection. NOT needed for balneum marie.
        2. LUTE_JOINTS (verlutiert vff einand): clay at glass-to-glass joints
           to prevent vapor escape. Required for distillation apparatus.
        3. PLUG (verstopfft mit zapffen): wooden stopper in vessel mouth
           or furnace air vents. Dual-use: storage + fire regulation.
        4. COVER (vermacht/verdeckt): general closure, lids.
        The curated JSON data (brunschwig_curated_v3.json) had merged these
        into a single SEAL action, which obscured a key distinction:
        balneum marie explicitly does NOT require luting (line 1348).
