    BCSC is NOT authoritative. Constraints are authoritative.
    BCSC describes the internal grammar of Currier B.
    Do not edit without updating source constraints first.
    Sections marked [TIER 3] contain behaviorally-derived interpretations
    that are conditional on external alignment (Brunschwig). These are
    included for operational grounding but do not carry Tier 0-2 authority.

  caveat: |
    Everything in this section is conditional on the Brunschwig structural
    alignment (fits F-BRU-001 through F-BRU-016). If that alignment is
    invalidated, glosses must be re-derived from internal correlations only.

      correlations (which kernel characters they co-occur with), REGIME
      distribution (which folios they concentrate in), section distribution,
      and Brunschwig operation alignment. Full dictionary: data/middle_dictionary.json

      The same characters used as MIDDLEs appear in suffix position with

  token_reading_pattern:

      A token reads as: PREFIX:MIDDLE.SUFFIX

    examples:
      - token: "qokedy"
        parse: "qo:k.edy"
        reading: "on energy channel: heat, then batch"
      - token: "chedy"
        parse: "ch:e.dy"
        reading: "on stability channel: cool, then close"
      - token: "sheckhy"

        reading: "on verify channel: hard precision, hazard flag"
      - token: "daiin"

      - token: "okeey"

      - token: "okaiin"

        reading: "VESSEL: seal permanently (C936 — ok selects vessel, am = finalize)"

  program_reading:
    description: |
      A B paragraph reads as a mini-program:
      Line 1 (HEADER):  Compound specification + folio identification
      Lines 2-N/3 (SPEC): Prep operations, parameter setting, unique vocabulary
      Lines N/3-2N/3 (BODY): Mixed heat/cool/check cycles
      Lines 2N/3-N (LOOP): Generic control loop, universal vocabulary, iterate suffixes
    line_reading: |
      Each line reads left-to-right with FL state tracking:
        da:FL:EARLY  sh:batch  qo:heat.deep_cool  ch:precision.close  ol:FL:END
        [init state]  [verify:  [energy: heat,     [stability: precision, [continue:
                       batch]    then deep cool]     then close]           end state]
