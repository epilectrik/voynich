# BCSC: Currier B Structural Contract
# Version: 1.8
# ============================================================
#
# This is a DERIVED, READ-ONLY specification.
# It introduces NO NEW CLAIMS.
# Constraints remain authoritative.
# Do not edit without constraint update.
#
# Purpose: Pure internal grammar contract describing what a
# valid Currier B program is, without referencing A or AZC.
#
# This is NOT a workflow description, simulation spec, or
# semantic interpretation. It is abstract control grammar.

    interpretation: |
      HT is the identification layer that complements the operational grammar (PP).
      Grammar (PP) encodes HOW to execute; HT encodes WHICH procedure is active.
      This division is by design - maintains semantic ceiling (C120).
