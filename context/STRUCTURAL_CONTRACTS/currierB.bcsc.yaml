# BCSC: Currier B Structural Contract
# Version: 1.2
# ============================================================
#
# This is a DERIVED, READ-ONLY specification.
# It introduces NO NEW CLAIMS.
# Constraints remain authoritative.
# Do not edit without constraint update.
#
# Purpose: Pure internal grammar contract describing what a
# valid Currier B program is, without referencing A or AZC.
#
# This is NOT a workflow description, simulation spec, or
# semantic interpretation. It is abstract control grammar.

      #   AX tokens use the SAME MIDDLEs as operational roles (98.2% PP).
      #   PREFIX determines whether a MIDDLE acts as AX or operational (C571).
      #   AX is not a separate vocabulary—it is a scaffold MODE of the pipeline.
      #
      # POSITIONAL SUB-STRUCTURE (C563):
      #   AX_INIT  (classes 3, 4, 5, 6): line-initial scaffold
      #   AX_MED   (classes 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29): medial scaffold
      #   AX_FINAL (classes 1, 2, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22): line-final scaffold
      #
      # BEHAVIORAL COLLAPSE (C572):
      #   20 classes do NOT form distinct behavioral groups.
      #   Transitions: uniform (only 3/20 structured). Context: below random baseline.
      #   Best clustering: k=2, silhouette=0.18. Position is the only differentiator.

      #
      # CO-OCCURRENCE:
      #   97.4% of class pairs co-occur; no pair mutually exclusive.
      #   At Jaccard 0.7, all 20 cluster together (functional coherence).

    Grammar is universal at CLASS level (same 49 classes everywhere).
    Differentiation occurs at TOKEN level within classes.
    This enables material-appropriate execution via variant selection,
    not via different procedures. (C506.b, C537)
