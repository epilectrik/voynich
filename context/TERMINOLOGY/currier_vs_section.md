# Currier Language vs Section

**Status:** CLOSED | Commonly confused terms

---

## Currier Language (A, B, AZC)

**Definition:** Text classification based on statistical/linguistic properties.

| Language | % Tokens | Folios | Characteristics |
|----------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Currier A | 30.5% | 114 | Non-sequential registry |
| Currier B | 61.9% | 83 | Sequential grammar |
| AZC | 7.7% | 30 | Hybrid (unclassified by Currier) |

**Key point:** A and B are FOLIO-DISJOINT (0 shared folios).

## Section (H, B, S, C, P, T, etc.)

**Definition:** Content/illustration-based divisions within the manuscript.

| Section | Content | Location |
|---------|---------|----------|
| H | Herbal (botanical illustrations) | Throughout |
| B | Biological/balneological | Central folios |
| S | Stellar/astronomical | Specific gatherings |
| C | Cosmological | Specific gatherings |
| P | Pharmaceutical (recipes?) | Specific gatherings |
| T | Text-only | Specific gatherings |

## The Confusion

"Section B" and "Currier B" are **different concepts**:
- Section B = Balneological content (bathing figures)
- Currier B = Statistical text classification (the sequential grammar)

Similarly:
- Section A = Astronomical content
- Currier A = Non-sequential registry text

## How They Interact

| Currier Language | Can appear in sections |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Currier A | H, P, T (botanical, pharmaceutical, text-only) |
| Currier B | H, S, B, C (herbal, stellar, biological, cosmological) |
| AZC | A, Z, C (astronomical, zodiac, cosmological) |

Sections and Currier languages are partially but not fully aligned.
