# C383: GLOBAL MORPHOLOGICAL TYPE SYSTEM

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Phase:** A-ARCH

---

## Claim

A single morphological type system spans ALL THREE text systems (Currier A, B, and AZC). Prefixes encode functional type globally, regardless of which grammar applies.

## The Type Dichotomy

| Type | Prefixes | Kernel Contact | LINK Affinity |
|------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| INTERVENTION | ch, sh, ok | 100% | Avoiding |
| MONITORING | da, sa | <5% | Attracted |

## Evidence Across Systems

| Property | Currier A | Currier B | AZC |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| ch/sh/ok kernel contact | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| da/sa kernel contact | <5% | <5% | <5% |
| LINK affinity patterns | Identical | Identical | Identical |
| Sequential grammar | NO | YES | Hybrid |

## What This Means

- **Same alphabet, different grammar**: A and B use same tokens differently
- **Type = function, not meaning**: Morphological type encodes operational role
- **No semantic transfer**: Vocabulary sharing doesn't imply meaning sharing
- **Architecture is type-based**: Type determines behavior, grammar determines sequence

## System-Specific Realization (C383a)

While the type system is global, realization varies:
- In B: Strong section-conditioning, mutual exclusivity
- In AZC: Less symmetric, boundary roles shift to ok/ot
- Infrastructure is ROLE-BASED, not token-fixed

## Related Constraints

- C372 - Kernel contact dichotomy in B
- C376 - Suffix kernel dichotomy mirrors prefix
- C382 - Morphology encodes control phase
- C383a - System-specific realization
- C384 - NO entry-level A-B coupling
