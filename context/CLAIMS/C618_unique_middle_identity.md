# C618: Unique MIDDLE Identity

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Scope:** CURRIER_B | **Source:** UNIQUE_VOCABULARY_ROLE

## Statement

The 858 unique MIDDLEs (C531: 64% of B MIDDLE types, appearing in exactly 1 folio each) are 100% UN tokens — zero appear in any classified ICC token. They are 99.7% hapax (862/865 word types appear exactly once), with extreme morphological properties: mean MIDDLE length 4.55 chars (vs 2.12 shared), 83.1% suffix rate (vs 49.2%), and 88.0% B-exclusive. Despite their novelty, 95.7% contain PP atoms as substrings, confirming they are compositional extensions of the shared morphological system, not foreign vocabulary.

## Evidence

### Classification Status

| Category | Unique MIDDLE tokens | Shared MIDDLE tokens |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Classified (EN/AX/FQ/FL/CC) | 0 (0.0%) | 16,054 (72.2%) |
| UN (unclassified) | 868 (100.0%) | 6,174 (27.8%) |

Zero unique MIDDLEs appear in any ICC-classified token. The entire unique vocabulary is within the unclassified population.

### PREFIX-Predicted Roles (for UN tokens)

| Predicted role | Count | % of unique tokens |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|
| EN | 344 | 39.6% |
| AX | 139 | 16.0% |
| Unpredictable | 385 | 44.4% |

44.4% cannot be assigned even by PREFIX prediction, reflecting extreme morphological distance from classified forms.

### Token Volume

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Unique MIDDLE tokens | 868 (3.8% of B) |
| Unique MIDDLE word types | 865 |
| Hapax among unique MIDDLE types | 862 (99.7%) |
| UN tokens with unique MIDDLEs | 868 (12.3% of UN) |

### Morphological Profile

| Metric | Unique | Shared | p-value |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| MIDDLE length (mean) | 4.55 | 2.12 | <0.000001 |
| Word length (mean) | 7.58 | 5.06 | <0.000001 |
| Suffix rate | 83.1% | 49.2% | - |
| Articulator rate | 2.0% | 4.5% | - |
| PP origin (types) | 12.0% | - | - |
| B-exclusive (types) | 88.0% | - | - |
| Contains PP atom | 95.7% | - | - |

### Line Position

| Metric | Unique | Shared | p-value |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Mean position | 0.544 | 0.498 | 0.000037 |
| Line-initial rate | 16.4% | 10.8% | - |
| Line-final rate | 22.7% | 10.6% | - |

Unique MIDDLE tokens are shifted toward line boundaries (both initial and final), consistent with longer tokens occupying more positional extremes.

## Interpretation

Unique MIDDLEs are the extreme morphological tail of B: the longest, most suffixed, most compositionally complex token forms. They are built from PP atoms (95.7% containment) in novel combinations that are too rare (99.7% hapax) to survive ICC cosurvival classification. Their folio-uniqueness is a mathematical consequence of single occurrence: a token appearing once in the manuscript necessarily appears in only one folio.

## Refines

- **C531**: Confirms prevalence (858 types, 81/82 folios). Adds: 100% UN, 99.7% hapax, morphologically extreme.
- **C532**: Confirms 88% B-exclusive. Adds: 12% PP, 0% RI, 95.7% PP atom containment.
- **C610**: Confirms UN morphological profile (elevated suffix/length). Unique MIDDLEs are the extreme tail of the UN distribution.
