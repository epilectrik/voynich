# Human Track (HT) - Context Summary

## CONTEXT-SUFFICIENT SUMMARY (PRIMARY)

This file is the **PRIMARY ENTRY AND EXIT POINT** for questions about:
- HT evidentiary status
- HT tier classification
- HT promotion limits
- Why HT claims cannot advance beyond current tiers

Do not consult other HT files unless performing a formal audit.

---

**Context-Sufficient:** YES

---

## Tier 2 (CLOSED)

- HT is a formally distinct, non-operational layer
- HT has no causal effect on execution or outcomes
- HT tokens can be fully removed without changing grammar behavior
- HT forms a third compositional notation system with disjoint prefix vocabulary

## Tier 3

- HT plausibly encodes attentional pacing synchronized to procedural phase

## Tier 4

- HT may represent handwriting or calligraphy practice during waiting phases

---

## Limits (STOP CONDITION)

- The calligraphy interpretation is **not promotable internally**
- No additional structural tests can discriminate intent
- Promotion requires **external historical or codicological evidence**

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Occurrences | ~40,000 (33.4%) |
| Unique types | ~11,000 |
| Section-exclusive | 80.7% |
| Hazard proximity | 4.84 vs 2.5 expected |
| Terminal independence | p=0.92 |

---

## Constraints

- C166-C170: Structural properties
- C341-C348: Stratification and synchrony
- C404-C406: Non-operational closure tests

---

Phase reports supply methodological detail only and cannot alter tier status.
