# Human Track (HT) - Context Summary

## CONTEXT-SUFFICIENT SUMMARY (PRIMARY)

This file is the **PRIMARY ENTRY POINT** for questions about HT.

**For formal hierarchy:** [HT_HIERARCHY.md](HT_HIERARCHY.md) (CANONICAL)

---

**Context-Sufficient:** YES

---

## Tier 0-1: Formal Status (FROZEN)

- HT is **non-operational** (systems do not read it)
- HT is **non-predictive** (conditioning on HT worsens prediction)
- HT is **removable without effect** (grammar unchanged)
- HT is **directionally downstream** (system→HT only, not HT→system)

## Tier 2: Structural Properties (FROZEN)

- HT has **modular morphology** (PREFIX + CORE + SUFFIX)
- Components are **independent and additive** (no synergy)
- HT shows **strong positional bias** (line-initial, line-final)
- HT is **system-conditioned** (A vs B vs AZC distributions differ)

## Tier 2.5: System-Specific (FROZEN)

| System | Anchoring Pressure | Key Pattern |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Currier A | Registry layout | Entry-boundary aligned, seam-avoiding |
| Currier B | Phase/attention | Waiting-profile correlated |
| AZC | Diagram geometry | Placement-synchronous |

## Tier 3: Interpretation (OPEN)

**Dual-Purpose Attention Mechanism:**
1. Maintained operator attention/alertness during waiting phases
2. Trained guild members in the art of the written form

This is NOT "doodling" or "scribbling" - the evidence shows highly structured, intentional practice:
- 7.81x rare grapheme engagement (practicing difficult forms)
- 24.5% boundary-pushing forms (exploring morphological limits)
- Section-level family rotation (systematic curriculum)
- Disjoint prefix vocabulary (separate training notation)
- 71.3% compositional (rule-following, not random)

## Tier 4: Narrative (OPTIONAL)

- Apprentice skill acquisition during operational waiting
- Medieval work-study combination model

---

## Limits (STOP CONDITION)

- Tier 3 interpretations are **not promotable internally**
- No additional structural tests can discriminate intent
- Promotion requires **external historical or codicological evidence**
