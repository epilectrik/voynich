# Human Track (HT) - Context Summary

## CONTEXT-SUFFICIENT SUMMARY (PRIMARY)

This file is the **PRIMARY ENTRY POINT** for questions about HT.

**For formal hierarchy:** [HT_HIERARCHY.md](HT_HIERARCHY.md) (CANONICAL)

---

**Context-Sufficient:** YES

---

## Tier 0-1: Formal Status (FROZEN evidence, REVISED interpretation)

- HT is **operationally redundant** (body encodes same atoms in simple form — C935)
- HT is **non-predictive** (conditioning on HT worsens prediction)
- HT is **removable without effect** (grammar unchanged — because redundant, not empty)
- HT is **directionally downstream** (system→HT only, not HT→system)

> **Revision (2026-02-06):** "Non-operational" reframed to "operationally redundant" per C935.
> HT compound MIDDLEs decompose to core atoms that appear in body lines (71.6% hit rate).
> HT tokens are dual-purpose: compound specification (operational) + identification (rare combination).

## Tier 2: Structural Properties (FROZEN)

- HT has **modular morphology** (PREFIX + CORE + SUFFIX)
- Components are **independent and additive** (no synergy)
- HT shows **strong positional bias** (line-initial, line-final)
- HT is **system-conditioned** (A vs B vs AZC distributions differ)

## Tier 2.5: System-Specific (FROZEN)

| System | Anchoring Pressure | Key Pattern |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Currier A | Registry layout | Entry-boundary aligned, seam-avoiding |
| Currier B | Phase/attention | Waiting-profile correlated |
| AZC | Diagram geometry | Placement-synchronous |

## Tier 3: Interpretation (OPEN — weakened by C935)

**Previous interpretation (weakened):**
1. ~~Maintained operator attention/alertness during waiting phases~~
2. ~~Trained guild members in the art of the written form~~

> **Revision (2026-02-06):** C935 provides a simpler explanation for HT structural properties:
> compound specification tokens that encode operational content in compressed form.
> The "attention/practice" interpretation is not ruled out but is no longer the best fit.

**Current best interpretation:**
- HT tokens are compound operational specifications
- Their rarity serves as program identification (like a part number)
- Their atoms encode the same operations as simpler body tokens
- The structured, compositional nature reflects operational compounding, not practice

Previously cited evidence now reinterpreted:
- 7.81x rare grapheme engagement = compound MIDDLEs are rare BY CONSTRUCTION (more atoms = more unique)
- 24.5% boundary-pushing forms = compound specification naturally explores MIDDLE space
- 71.3% compositional = compound structure IS compositional (this is expected, not surprising)
- Disjoint prefix vocabulary = compound tokens use different prefix distributions (C743)

## Tier 4: Narrative (OPTIONAL)

- Apprentice skill acquisition during operational waiting
- Medieval work-study combination model

---

## Limits (STOP CONDITION)

- Tier 3 interpretations are **not promotable internally**
- No additional structural tests can discriminate intent
- Promotion requires **external historical or codicological evidence**
