# C902: Late Currier A Register Characteristics

**Tier:** 2
**Scope:** A
**Phase:** TOKEN_ANNOTATION_BATCH_11

## Constraint

Folios f100-f102 exhibit distinct register characteristics compared to the main Currier A body: concentrated p/f-domain tokens, extended vowel patterns, very short lines, and morphological "MONSTERS" (exceptionally long compound tokens). This suggests specialized appendix/addendum content.

## Evidence

From systematic annotation of late Currier A folios:

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | f100-f102 | Earlier Currier A |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Extended vowels | Quadruple e (odeeeey) | Typically double |
| Gallows domain | Heavy p/f concentration | Mixed k/t dominant |
| Line length | Very short (2-token minimum) | More varied |
| Compounds | MONSTERS present | Standard length |
| RI non-L1 | High frequency | Lower frequency |

### Specific Observations

**f102v2 L2**: Only 2 tokens ("soe + dy") - minimal specification unit

**f102v2 L6**: Contains `odeeeey` with quadruple-e - maximum e-extension

**f101r1**: Contains COMPOUND MONSTER `ctheockhosho`:
- ct- (PREFIX, C889 ct-reserved domain)
- Multiple embedded gallows
- 12+ characters (exceptional length)

**f101v2**: Contains COMPOUND MONSTER `soefchocphy`:
- f-gallows embedded mid-token
- Multiple prefix units stacked
- Evidence of morphological composition beyond standard patterns

### Gallows Domain Concentration

Per C530 (Gallows Domain Coherence), p and f are rare specialized markers that never achieve folio dominance in the general corpus. Their concentration in late Currier A suggests these folios document:

1. Specialized edge cases
2. Exceptions to main registry organization
3. Materials requiring unique encoding

## Interpretation

Late Currier A functions as an **appendix or addendum** containing:

1. **Edge cases** that strain normal encoding capacity
2. **Specialized materials** requiring concentrated rare-domain markers
3. **Extreme specifications** using maximum morphological extension

The COMPOUND MONSTERS represent **compositional stacking** - when standard vocabulary is insufficient, new tokens are constructed by combining multiple PREFIX+MIDDLE units.
