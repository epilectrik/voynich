# C975: Fingerprint Joint Uniqueness UNCOMMON

**Tier:** 2 | **Scope:** B | **Phase:** FINGERPRINT_UNIQUENESS

## Statement

The Voynich B 11-property statistical fingerprint is jointly UNCOMMON among generic sparse categorical grammars: Fisher's combined p = 7.67e-08, worst-case single-test p = 0.024. Four of eleven properties discriminate universally; four are non-discriminating at 49-class granularity.

## Fingerprint Summary

| Test | Properties | Verdict | Worst p |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| T1 Transition Structure | F2, F3, F4 | RARE | 0.0001 |
| T2 Markov Dynamics | F5, F6, F10 | RARE | 0.000 |
| T3 Compositional Sparsity | F7, F8, F11 | UNCOMMON | 0.012 |
| T4 Positional Structure | F9 | UNCOMMON | 0.024 |

## Discriminating Properties (4/11)

1. **F2 — 100% asymmetric depletion** (T1, p <= 0.0001): Directional flow, not random avoidance
2. **F10 — Low cross-line MI** (T2, p = 0.000): Grammar resets harder than random Markov
3. **F11 — Suffix-role chi2** (T3, p = 0.000 vs class reassign): Role-suffix binding structural
4. **F9 — Role-position MI** (T4, p = 0.000 vs within-line shuffle): Positional role structure real

## Non-Discriminating at 49-Class Level (4/11)

- **F3** Clustering coefficient — random graphs cluster similarly
- **F4** One-way kernel — operates within roles (C521), invisible at class level
- **F5** First-order BIC sufficiency — universal for sparse Markov chains
- **F6** Sharp hazard gate — operates within roles (C967), invisible at class level

## Partially Discriminating (3/11)

- **F7** Incompatibility — kills latent models, marginal vs shuffle
- **F8** Hub rationing — kills latent models, marginal vs others
- **F1** Class count (49/479, 9.8x compression) — not directly tested

## Joint Probability

| Method | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fisher's combined | p = 7.67e-08 |
| Conservative product | p = 2.83e-10 |
| Worst single test | p = 0.024 |

## Verdict

**UNCOMMON.** The fingerprint cannot be generated by accident from random categorical grammars. The joint constellation of asymmetric depletion + hard line resets + role-suffix binding + positional role structure is structurally distinctive. However, individual properties taken alone are not extraordinary — it is the combination that is rare. Consistent with designed system, not random generation.
