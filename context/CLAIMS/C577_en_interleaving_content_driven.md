# C577 - EN Interleaving is Content-Driven

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Scope:** B

## Statement
QO and CHSH occupy identical line positions (mean 0.490 vs 0.480, Mann-Whitney p=0.104). Interleaving varies by section: BIO 58.5%, RECIPE_B 56.2%, HERBAL_B 48.0%, PHARMA 27.5%. Alternation is driven by content (material type) not position. PHARMA interleaving collapse confirms C555.

## Evidence
- Position: QO mean=0.490, CHSH mean=0.480, p=0.104 (NOT significant)
- BIO interleaving: 58.5%
- RECIPE_B interleaving: 56.2%
- HERBAL_B interleaving: 48.0%
- PHARMA interleaving: 27.5% (0.57x vs HERBAL_B)
- REGIME_4 lower interleaving: 52.2% vs REGIME_1-3 ~58%
