# C939: Zone-Exclusive MIDDLEs Are Compositional Variants

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Scope:** B | **Source:** MIDDLE_MATERIAL_SEMANTICS

## Statement

Zone-exclusive rare MIDDLEs are compositional elaborations of common MIDDLEs, not independent identifiers. 89.4% are edit-distance-1 from a common MIDDLE (single character insertion or substitution), and 97.9% contain a common MIDDLE as a substring. Zone-exclusive and non-exclusive rare MIDDLEs are statistically indistinguishable in their compositional distance (Mann-Whitney p=0.978, Cohen's d=-0.046). This is the key evidence against material-level identity encoding in MIDDLE morphology.

## Evidence

### Zone-Exclusive Rare MIDDLEs (n=47)

| Distance from Nearest Common | Count | % |
|-----------------------------|-------|---|
| Distance 1 | 42 | 89.4% |
| Distance 2 | 5 | 10.6% |
| Distance 3+ | 0 | 0.0% |

- Mean distance: 1.11
- 97.9% contain or are contained by a common MIDDLE (substring relationship)

### Non-Exclusive Control Group (n=49)

| Distance | Count | % |
|----------|-------|---|
| Distance 1 | 44 | 89.8% |
| Distance 2 | 4 | 8.2% |
| Distance 3+ | 1 | 2.0% |

- Mean distance: 1.12
- 98.0% containment rate

### Comparison

- Mann-Whitney U = 1154.0, p = 0.978 (no difference)
- Cohen's d = -0.046 (negligible)
- Chi-square (elaboration vs independent): p = 1.0

### Context: All Rare MIDDLEs (n=1,143)

- Distance 1: 46.9%
- Distance 2: 33.7%
- Distance 3+: 19.4%
- Mean distance: 1.81

The zone-exclusivity filter does NOT concentrate morphologically distant forms — it actually excludes them entirely (0% distance-3+). Morphologically distant rare MIDDLEs are either always hapax or spread across zones, inconsistent with a material-naming role.

## Interpretation

Zone-exclusive rare MIDDLEs are single-character variants of common operational MIDDLEs deployed in specific procedural phases. They represent operational elaboration (e.g., a slightly modified version of a common operation for a specific phase context), not independent material identifiers. This confirms C501's prediction (65.9% distance-1 for B-exclusive MIDDLEs) and extends it to the phase-exclusive subset (89.4%).

The semantic ceiling (C120) stands: material encoding, if present in the manuscript, does NOT live in MIDDLE morphology.
