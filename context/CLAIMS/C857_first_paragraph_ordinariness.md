# C857: First Paragraph Ordinariness

**Status:** Validated
**Tier:** 2
**Phase:** FOLIO_PARAGRAPH_ARCHITECTURE
**Scope:** B

## Statement

Paragraph 1 is **NOT structurally distinct** from later paragraphs. HT rate (0.94x), role distribution (negligible delta), and vocabulary predictivity (11.8%) all indicate Par 1 is simply the first in a sequence of equals.

## Evidence

```
HT rate: Par 1 = 34.6%, Later = 36.8% (ratio 0.94x)

Role distribution:
  EN: Par 1 = 25.6%, Later = 25.1% (+0.5%)
  FL: Par 1 = 4.4%, Later = 3.8% (+0.5%)
  FQ: Par 1 = 15.1%, Later = 15.4% (-0.3%)
  CC: Par 1 = 4.2%, Later = 3.4% (+0.8%)

Vocabulary predictivity: 11.8%
(Only 11.8% of later paragraph vocab appears in Par 1)
```

## Interpretation

Par 1 does NOT function as a template or header that defines the folio. All paragraphs are equivalent mini-programs operating under the same role profile.

## Verdict

ORDINARY - Par 1 is not special.
