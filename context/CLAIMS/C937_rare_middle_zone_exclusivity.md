# C937: Rare MIDDLE Zone-Exclusivity

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Scope:** B | **Source:** MIDDLE_MATERIAL_SEMANTICS

## Statement

Rare MIDDLEs (appearing in <15 folios) are significantly more zone-exclusive than common MIDDLEs. 55.1% of rare MIDDLE-folio pairs appear in exactly one procedural zone (SETUP/PROCESS/FINISH) vs 25.5% for common MIDDLEs (Mann-Whitney U=219,821, p=2.97e-15, Cohen's d=0.67). This is a genuine structural feature, not a hapax artifact (hapax excluded; only MIDDLEs with 2+ occurrences per folio tested).

## Evidence

### Primary Result

| Group | Zone-Exclusive Rate | N (middle-folio pairs) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Rare (<15 folios) | 55.1% (81/147) | 147 |
| Common (15+ folios) | 25.5% (589/2,308) | 2,308 |

- Mann-Whitney U = 219,820.5, p = 2.97e-15
- Cohen's d = 0.672 (medium-to-large effect)
- 80 Currier B folios analyzed
- Zone assignment: SETUP (1st paragraph), PROCESS (middle), FINISH (last paragraph)

### Frequency-Controlled Replication (Test 11)

At stricter threshold (3+ occurrences per folio):
- Rare: 33.3% zone-exclusive (9/27)
- Common: 16.2% (282/1,740)
- Mann-Whitney p = 0.009
- However, permutation baseline p = 0.144 (absolute rate not significantly above chance)

### Zone Preference

Both rare and common exclusive MIDDLEs overwhelmingly prefer the PROCESS zone (71/81 rare, 509/589 common), reflecting PROCESS zone's majority token share.

## Interpretation

Rare MIDDLEs are deployed in specific procedural phases rather than distributed uniformly across the folio's operational sequence. This phase-restriction is a structural property of the operational grammar, not evidence for material-level semantics (see C939 — zone-exclusive MIDDLEs are compositional elaborations of common MIDDLEs, not independent identifiers).
