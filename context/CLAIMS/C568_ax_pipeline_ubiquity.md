# C568: AX Pipeline Ubiquity

**Tier:** 2 (Structural Inference)
**Phase:** AX_FUNCTIONAL_ANATOMY
**Scope:** Currier A-B pipeline / AX necessity

## Claim

AX vocabulary is carried by 97.2% of Currier A records and is structurally guaranteed in every B execution context. AX is not optional infrastructure -- it is an always-present component of the grammar.

## Evidence

### A-Record Coverage
- 1,535/1,579 A records (97.2%) carry at least 1 AX PP MIDDLE
- 44 records (2.8%) lack AX MIDDLEs -- all are tiny records (1-4 total MIDDLEs)
- Mean 3.7 AX MIDDLEs per A record (median 4, max 10)
- Top AX MIDDLEs are universal single-character forms: o (60%), i (39%), e (34%), a (27%), y (24%)

### B-Context Necessity
- 0 records produce zero AX surviving classes
- Classes 21, 22 (both AX_FINAL) survive in 100% of contexts
- AX_FINAL always present (100%), AX_INIT 95.9%, AX_MED 97.0%
- All three subgroups present in 95.6% of contexts
- 41 records (2.6%) produce only AX_FINAL (no INIT or MED)

## Interpretation

AX is not an optional or incidental part of the grammar. The simplest, most universal MIDDLEs (single vowels and consonants) are what create AX vocabulary. Because these MIDDLEs are nearly universal in A records, AX is structurally guaranteed.

## Dependencies

- C563: AX positional stratification (INIT/MED/FINAL)
- C567: AX-operational MIDDLE sharing
