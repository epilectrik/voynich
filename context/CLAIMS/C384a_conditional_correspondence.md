# C384.a: Conditional Record-Level Correspondence PERMITTED

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Phase:** ANIMAL_PRECISION_CORRELATION

---

## Claim

C384 does not prohibit correspondence between Currier A records and Currier B folios that emerges conditionally through:

- Multi-axis constraint composition
- AZC positional encoding
- Survivor-set collapse (C481)
- External expert priors (e.g., Brunschwig)
- Multi-dimensional PP convergence at RECORD level
- PREFIX profile matching to instruction patterns

Such correspondence is **structural and contingent**, not semantic, referential, or lookup-based.

## Why This Permission Exists

C384 was written to block primitive lookup thinking:
- "Token X means Y"
- "A entry Z maps to B folio W"

But subsequent phases proved that **emergent correspondence** via constraint collapse is real:

| Phase | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| A-ARCH (C473) | A record = constraint bundle |
| SURVIVOR_SET (C481) | Survivor-set uniqueness exists |
| AZC_LEGALITY (C442-444) | AZC routing is mandatory |
| BRUNSCHWIG_BACKPROP (F-BRU-004) | A-register cluster stability |
| ANIMAL_PRECISION_CORRELATION | Record-level PP convergence is real |

Without C384.a, AIs abort valid tests by over-applying C384.

## The Correct Model

```
FORBIDDEN (C384):
  Token -> meaning
  Token -> folio
  Entry -> folio (context-free)
  Single-axis similarity

PERMITTED (C384.a):
  Record -> folio (via multi-axis composition)
  Survivor-set collapse -> unique A record
  Brunschwig recipe -> A record (via triangulation)
  PREFIX profile matching -> instruction sequence
```

## Canonical Rule

> **"Currier A never names anything, but Currier A records can correspond to Currier B execution contexts when sufficient constraints collapse through AZC."**

## Evidence: ANIMAL_PRECISION_CORRELATION + MATERIAL_MAPPING_V2

The recipe triangulation methodology demonstrates:

1. Single PP tokens: 90% folio overlap (non-discriminative)
2. Multi-dimensional PP at RECORD level: discriminates
3. PREFIX profile matching: identifies instruction patterns
4. ~~Result: eoschso = ennen (chicken)~~ **INVALIDATED (v2.78)** - eoschso is NOT initial RI

**Corrected Evidence (MATERIAL_MAPPING_V2):**
- A records are paragraphs, not lines
- Initial RI = RI tokens in first line of paragraph
- 6 PRECISION candidates identified via paragraph-level PP triangulation
- Kernel signature (k+e >> h) validates BRSC predictions

This process:
- Uses multi-axis constraint composition
- Maps through AZC positional correspondence
- Achieves record-level correspondence
- Does NOT violate C384's prohibition on primitive lookup

## What This Does NOT Permit

- Semantic decoding
- Dictionary construction
- "A token X means substance Y"
- Context-free entry-folio claims
- Bypassing AZC routing

## Quantitative Evidence (A_B_CORRESPONDENCE_SYSTEMATIC)

C885 establishes the definitive operational answer:

| A Unit | B Unit | Coverage | Lift vs Random |
|--------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Single Paragraph | B Paragraph | 58.3% | 2.04x |
| **A Folio** | **B Paragraph** | **81.2%** | **1.71x** |
| 2-3 A Paragraphs | B Paragraph | 76-80% | - |

**Interpretation:** A folios are the operational unit for B vocabulary correspondence. Single A paragraphs are insufficient (58%) but aggregation to folio level achieves 81% coverage, which is sufficient for B program execution.

## Related Constraints

- **C384** - No token-level or context-free A-B lookup
- **C885** - A-B Vocabulary Correspondence (81% at folio level)
- C473 - A record = constraint bundle
- C481 - Survivor-set uniqueness
- C442-444 - AZC positional encoding
- C335 - 69.8% vocabulary integration
- C383 - Global type system
- C846 - A-B paragraph pool relationship
