# C836: RI Linker ct-Prefix Signature

**Tier:** 2 (observation), Tier 3 (interpretation)
**Scope:** A
**Phase:** A_RECORD_B_ROUTING_TOPOLOGY

## Constraint

75% of RI linker tokens (3/4) share the ct-prefix with 'ho' or 'heo' MIDDLE. This morphological concentration suggests ct-prefix may mark "linkable output" tokens within the RI vocabulary.

## Evidence

From t18_ri_link_network.py:

**Linker Morphology:**

| Linker | Prefix | Middle | Suffix | Pattern |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| cthody | ct | ho | dy | ct-ho-dy |
| ctho | ct | ho | (none) | ct-ho |
| ctheody | ct | heo | dy | ct-heo-dy |
| qokoiiin | qo | koi | iin | (outlier) |

**Observations:**

1. 3/4 linkers (75%) have ct-prefix
2. All ct-linkers share 'ho' or 'heo' MIDDLE (related forms)
3. 2/3 ct-linkers have -dy suffix
4. qokoiiin is the only non-ct linker (qo-prefix)

**Supporting Context:**

From C282: ct-prefix is A-enriched (0.14x in B)
From C273: ct-prefix is 85.9% Section H

## Interpretation (Tier 3)

The ct-prefix concentration suggests morphological marking of linking function:

- **ct-prefix** may mark "registry infrastructure" tokens - forms that serve organizational/navigational functions within A rather than encoding material discriminations
- **'ho/heo' MIDDLE** may specifically encode "output linkage" semantics
- **qokoiiin** as outlier suggests there may be multiple linker types (ct-type vs qo-type)

This is speculative but consistent with the pattern that ct-prefix tokens serve structural rather than content roles in Currier A.

## Status

CONFIRMED (observation) / SPECULATIVE (interpretation)
