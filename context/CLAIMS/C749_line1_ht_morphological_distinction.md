# C749: First-Line HT Morphological Distinction

**Tier:** 2 — STRUCTURAL INFERENCE
**Phase:** B_LINE_POSITION_HT
**Scope:** Currier B, HT tokens

## Statement

HT tokens appearing on line 1 are morphologically distinct from HT tokens on working lines (2+). First-line HT has elevated `pch` prefix (7.0% vs 1.9%), reduced `qo` prefix (9.4% vs 12.4%), higher articulator rate (13.0% vs 9.9%), and dramatically higher type uniqueness (95.9% vs 62.8% unique types). PREFIX distributions differ with chi-squared = 496.37, p < 10^-6.

## Evidence

| Feature | Line-1 HT | Working HT |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Token count | 414 | 6,628 |
| Unique types | 397 (95.9%) | 4,164 (62.8%) |
| `pch` prefix | 7.0% | 1.9% |
| `qo` prefix | 9.4% | 12.4% |
| `chsh` prefix | 20.8% | 24.6% |
| No prefix | 19.8% | 16.1% |
| Articulator rate | 13.0% | 9.9% |
| PREFIX chi-squared | 496.37, p < 10^-6 |

The 95.9% type uniqueness on line 1 (vs 62.8% working) indicates first-line HT tokens are overwhelmingly one-time forms — even more so than the general HT population (which already has 78.9% singletons per C406).

## Interpretation

The opening line draws from a different morphological sub-population of HT vocabulary. The near-total uniqueness suggests these are compositional forms generated for identification/header purposes rather than reusable operational tokens.

## Depends On

- C747 (line-1 HT enrichment)
- C406 (HT Zipf/hapax profile)
- C610 (UN morphological profile)
