# C461: HT Density Correlates with MIDDLE Rarity

**Tier:** 3 | **Scope:** A->B | **Status:** OPEN | **Phase:** Perturbation Space

---

## Statement

Human Track markers occur more frequently in Currier B contexts containing rare (Tail) MIDDLEs than common (Core) MIDDLEs. This indicates that the HT layer anticipates recognition difficulty rather than execution difficulty.

---

## Evidence

| Metric | Core | Tail | Ratio |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| Tokens | 10,174 | 3,493 | - |
| HT marker rate | 18.70% | 29.54% | 1.58x |

Chi-squared = 180.56, p < 0.0001

---

## Interpretation

The HT layer is **anticipatory**, not reactive. When the A-layer produces a rare MIDDLE (perturbation space recognition), the HT layer marks the context for heightened attention.

This is consistent with:
- **C404-405**: HT is non-operational but cognitively functional
- **C459**: HT anticipates stress

---

## Constraints Supported

- Refines C459 (HT anticipates stress)
- Consistent with C404 (HT terminal independence)
