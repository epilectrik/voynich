# C808: LINK 'ol' is a PP MIDDLE

## Constraint

'ol' (the LINK marker) is a **legitimate PP MIDDLE**:
- Appears 759 times as standalone MIDDLE
- Present in Currier A vocabulary (PP = pipeline-participating)
- Appears in MIDDLE position 40.6% of LINK tokens

LINK tokens have similar PP rate to non-LINK:
- LINK PP rate: 92.4%
- Non-LINK PP rate: 93.9%
- Chi-square: chi2=9.6, p=0.002 (significant but small effect)

## Evidence

'ol' morphological position in LINK tokens:
| Position | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| MIDDLE | 1,238 | 40.6% |
| PREFIX | 875 | 28.7% |
| SUFFIX | 344 | 11.3% |
| Spans boundary | 590 | 19.4% |

Top MIDDLEs in LINK tokens (all PP):
1. ol (759)
2. l (393)
3. k (303)
4. eol (281)
5. ch (97)

96 unique MIDDLEs contain 'ol' as substring.

## Interpretation

LINK is not a special marker outside the morphological system. 'ol' is a regular MIDDLE component that happens to define the LINK category. The high PP rate (92.4%) confirms LINK tokens are part of the pipeline vocabulary, not an external annotation layer.
