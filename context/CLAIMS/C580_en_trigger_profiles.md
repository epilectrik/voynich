# C580 - EN Trigger Profile Differentiation

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Scope:** B

## Statement
CHSH entry from non-EN context is more strongly triggered by AX (32.5%) and CC (11.0%) roles; QO entry is more triggered by EN-self (53.5%) and line-boundary (68.8%) contexts. Chi-square test: chi2=133.97, p<0.001. Despite functional identity (C574), the two prefix families have different entry pathways.

## Evidence
- QO triggers: UN 51.1%, AX 28.0%, FQ 14.1%, CC 5.0%, FL 1.7%
- CHSH triggers: UN 35.1%, AX 32.5%, FQ 14.2%, CC 11.0%, FL 7.2%
- Chi-square: chi2=133.97, p<0.001
- Section x Subfamily: chi2=122.03, p<0.001 (PHARMA 72.5% CHSH vs BIO 48.9%)
