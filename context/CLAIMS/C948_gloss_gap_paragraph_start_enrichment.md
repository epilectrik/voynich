# C948: Gloss Gap Paragraph-Start Enrichment

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Scope:** B | **Source:** MATERIAL_LOCUS_SEARCH

## Statement

Unglossed MIDDLEs ("gloss gaps" — tokens whose MIDDLEs have no entry in the operational dictionary) are 4.03x enriched at paragraph-start positions and 1.62x enriched at line-end positions, relative to the overall token distribution. Gap rates are section-specific: section H (8.6%) has 3.6x the gap rate of section B (2.4%). However, the 16 morphologically distinct gap MIDDLEs (edit distance >2 from any glossed MIDDLE) are all hapax legomena, limiting their interpretive value.

## Evidence

### Positional Enrichment

| Position | Expected | Observed | Enrichment |
|----------|----------|----------|------------|
| par_start | 2.8% | 11.3% | 4.03x |
| line_end | 9.5% | 15.5% | 1.62x |
| line_start | 7.4% | 6.5% | 0.89x |
| line_mid | 80.3% | 66.7% | 0.83x |

### Section Gap Rates

| Section | Gap Rate |
|---------|----------|
| H | 8.6% |
| T | 6.6% |
| S | 4.5% |
| C | 4.3% |
| B | 2.4% |

### Gap Characteristics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total tokens sampled | 3,566 (10 folios) |
| Glossed | 3,398 (95.3%) |
| Gaps | 168 (4.7%) |
| Hapax gaps | 134 (79.8%) |
| Distinct gaps (dist>2) | 16 (9.5%) |
| All distinct gaps are hapax | Yes |

### Interpretation

The positional and section-specific patterns are genuine structural signals — paragraph starts and line ends are where the operational grammar admits unusual vocabulary. Section H's high gap rate is consistent with herbal folios needing more context-specific terms.

**Critical limitation:** The universal hapax status of all 16 morphologically distinct gaps means these cannot be confirmed as systematic material markers. They may be compositional tail forms generated on-the-fly rather than a fixed material vocabulary. The structural pattern (enrichment at paragraph boundaries) is established, but the material-marking interpretation is NOT supported by the data.
