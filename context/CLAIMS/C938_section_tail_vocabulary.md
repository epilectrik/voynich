# C938: Section-Specific Tail Vocabulary

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Scope:** B | **Source:** MIDDLE_MATERIAL_SEMANTICS

## Statement

Each manuscript section maintains a distinct tail MIDDLE vocabulary (rare MIDDLEs appearing in <15 folios). Section-exclusive rates range from 42% to 66% (Section S highest at 65.9%). Within-section Jaccard similarity exceeds between-section Jaccard by 1.40x (p=1.29e-06). This extends C909 (section-specific MIDDLE vocabularies) from common to rare MIDDLEs, and quantifies rare MIDDLE section concentration (mean 0.654 vs 0.438 for common, p≈0).

## Evidence

### Section-Exclusive Tail Rates

| Section | Exclusive Rate | N Tail MIDDLEs |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| S (Stars/Recipes) | 65.9% | ~highest |
| T (Text) | ~55% | moderate |
| B (Biological) | ~48% | moderate |
| H (Herbal) | ~45% | moderate |
| C (Cosmological) | ~42% | lowest |

### Section Clustering (Test 2)

- 380 rare MIDDLEs analyzed
- Mean section concentration: 0.654 (rare) vs 0.438 (common)
- p ≈ 0 (permutation test)

### Within vs Between Section Sharing (Test 5)

- 48.5% of tail MIDDLEs are section-exclusive
- Within-section Jaccard / Between-section Jaccard = 1.40
- p = 1.29e-06

### Cross-Folio Consistency (Test 13)

Within-section: Spearman rho = 0.183 (p=0.004) — approaching material-encoding threshold
Between-section: rho = 0.013 (p=0.785) — no correlation

## Interpretation

Section identity constrains which rare MIDDLEs appear, consistent with sections representing different material domains (C909) that require different operational variants. The signal is strongest within sections, vanishing across sections. This is an extension of C909 into the rare tail of the MIDDLE distribution.
