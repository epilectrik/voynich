# C301: AZC is HYBRID

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Phase:** AZC

---

## Claim

The Astronomical/Zodiac/Cosmological (AZC) text is a genuine HYBRID system that bridges Currier A and B, belonging fully to neither.

## Classification Evidence

| Metric | AZC | Threshold | Verdict |
|--------|-----|-----------|---------|
| B vocabulary coverage | 69.7% | 70% | Just below |
| A vocabulary coverage | 65.4% | - | Moderate |
| Shared vocabulary (A∩B) | 60.5% | - | Core overlap |
| Unique vocabulary | 25.4% | - | Distinct terms |

## Distinctive Properties

| Property | AZC | Currier A | Currier B |
|----------|-----|-----------|-----------|
| Token percentage | 8.7% | 30.5% | 61.9% |
| Folios | 30 | 114 | 83 |
| TTR | 0.285 | 0.137 | 0.096 |
| Tokens/line (median) | 8 | 22 | 31 |
| LINK density | 7.6% | 3.0% | 6.6% |

## AZC-Unique Vocabulary (C304-305)

- 903 types (27.4%) absent from both A and B
- 98% section-exclusive
- 37% line-initial, 37% line-final
- 65.9% hapax (most appear only once)
- Structural signature: LABELING function

## P-Text Reclassification Note (2026-01-19)

Of the 3,299 AZC tokens, 398 (12.1%) are P-placement paragraph text that is linguistically A-like:
- PREFIX cosine to Currier A: 0.946
- PREFIX cosine to AZC diagram: 0.777
- Exclusive vocab ratio: 5.7x more types shared only with A

**Analytical recommendation:** For AZC legality analysis, use diagram-only count (**2,901 tokens**). P-text represents Currier A material physically co-located with AZC diagrams, not hybrid AZC content.

## Related Constraints

- C300 - 3,299 tokens unclassified by Currier (398 P-text, 2,901 diagram)
- C302 - Distinct line structure
- C303 - Elevated LINK density
- C306 - Placement-coding axis
- C322 - SEASON-GATED WORKFLOW interpretation
