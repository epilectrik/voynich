# C941: Section Is the Primary Vocabulary Organizer

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Scope:** B | **Source:** MATERIAL_LOCUS_SEARCH

## Statement

Folio-level MIDDLE vocabulary profiles cluster strongly by section (ARI=0.40, NMI=0.53, permutation p<0.0001) but show near-zero residual structure after section means are removed (residual ARI=-0.004 to +0.015 across k=4-6). Section identity is the dominant — and essentially the only — organizer of MIDDLE vocabulary profiles. No sub-section "material category" structure exists in folio vocabulary space.

## Evidence

### Clustering Results (k=5, primary)

| Metric | Observed | Null Mean | p-value |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Section ARI | 0.4019 | 0.0003 | 0.0001 |
| Section NMI | 0.5344 | 0.0752 | 0.0001 |
| Regime ARI | 0.0768 | 0.0001 | 0.0010 |
| Regime NMI | 0.1163 | 0.0577 | 0.0168 |

### Residual Clustering (after section-mean removal)

| k | ARI (section) | ARI (regime) |
|---|--------------|-------------|
| 4 | -0.004 | 0.004 |
| 5 | 0.005 | 0.007 |
| 6 | 0.015 | 0.007 |

All near zero. Once section is factored out, no meaningful clustering remains.

### Cross-Section Folios

19 folios cluster against their section assignment (e.g., 5 S folios cluster with B). These are boundary cases, not evidence of a hidden material dimension.

### Method

82 Currier B folios, 72 common MIDDLEs (20+ folios), cosine distance, Ward linkage, 10,000 permutations.

## Relationship to C909

C909 established that 96% of MIDDLEs are section-specific. C941 extends this by establishing that section membership EXHAUSTS the vocabulary organizing dimension — the residual after section removal approaches zero. C909 is "sections have different vocabularies." C941 is "there is nothing else organizing vocabulary beyond section."
