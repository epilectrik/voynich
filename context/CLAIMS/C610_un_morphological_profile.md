# C610: UN Morphological Profile

**Tier:** 2 (STRUCTURAL INFERENCE)
**Status:** CLOSED
**Source:** Phase UN_COMPOSITIONAL_MECHANICS
**Scope:** B_INTERNAL | UN | MORPHOLOGY

## Statement

UN tokens (7,042 = 30.5% of B) are morphologically normal but distinctively complex. They have 2x the suffix rate (77.3% vs 38.7%), 5.3x the articulator rate (10.1% vs 1.9%), and longer mean word length than classified tokens. 79.4% of UN tokens have PP (pipeline-participating) MIDDLEs, 0% have RI (A-exclusive) MIDDLEs. Elevated morphological complexity is the mechanism of non-classification, not structural deviance.

## Evidence

### Inventory (C566 Verification)

| Metric | Measured | C566 Expected |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| UN tokens | 7,042 | ~7,042 |
| Unique types | 4,421 | ~4,421 |
| Hapax rate | 74.1% | ~74.1% |

### Morphological Signature

| Feature | UN | Classified | Ratio |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------|
| PREFIX rate | 83.7% | 83.1% | 1.01x |
| SUFFIX rate | 77.3% | 38.7% | **2.00x** |
| Articulator rate | 10.1% | 1.9% | **5.32x** |

### PREFIX Distribution

Top UN prefixes: ch (13.9%), qo (12.3%), sh (10.4%), ol (5.7%), ot (4.4%), ok (4.1%). The three EN-associated prefixes (ch, qo, sh) account for 36.6% of UN tokens. Extended prefixes (pch, yk, lk, dch, ct) are 2-4x enriched in UN relative to classified.

### MIDDLE Classification

| Category | Token-level | Type-level |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| PP (shared) | 79.4% | 30.2% |
| RI (A-exclusive) | 0.0% | 0.0% |
| Novel (neither) | 20.6% | 69.8% |

90.7% of novel MIDDLEs contain at least one PP atom — they are compositionally derived from known PP building blocks, not structurally alien.

### Section Distribution

| Section | UN % |
|---------|------|
| B (Biological) | 22.3% (lowest) |
| H (Herbal-B) | 32.9% |
| C | 32.8% |
| S (Stars) | 34.1% |
| T | 39.0% (highest) |

Section B has lowest UN proportion, consistent with its more constrained vocabulary.
