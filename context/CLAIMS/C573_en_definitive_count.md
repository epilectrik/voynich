# C573 - EN Definitive Count: 18 Classes

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Scope:** B

## Statement
The ENERGY (EN) role contains exactly 18 instruction classes: {8, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49}. This resolves the BCSC discrepancy (which said 11) and the CSV undercounting (which said 6). The ICC classification is definitive.

## Evidence
- ICC classification identifies 18 EN classes (removing FL classes 38, 40 from range 31-49, adding class 8)
- Token coverage: 7,211 tokens = 31.22% of Currier B (23,243 total)
- Core 6 classes ({8, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36}): 5,732 tokens = 79.5% of EN
- Minor 12 classes: 1,479 tokens = 20.5% of EN
- Prefix families: QO (7 classes), CH_SH (10 classes), MINOR (1 class: 41)
