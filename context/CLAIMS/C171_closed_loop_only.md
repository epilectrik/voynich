# C171: Only Continuous Closed-Loop Process Control Survives

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Phase:** PCI

---

## Claim

Of all purpose classes tested, only continuous closed-loop process control is structurally compatible with the Currier B grammar. All other hypotheses have been eliminated.

## Eliminated Purpose Classes

| Purpose Class | Reason for Elimination |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Cipher/hoax | Phase G: transforms DECREASE MI |
| Encoded language | Phase X.5: 0.19% reference rate |
| Recipe/pharmacology | No batch boundaries |
| Herbarium/taxonomy | No identifier tokens |
| Medical procedure | No patient-response branching |
| Astronomical calculation | No computational primitives |
| Ritual/symbolic | No conditional structure |
| Educational text | No definitions or examples |
| Discrete batch operations | No end markers |
| Fermentation | No time-dependent markers |
| Glassmaking/metallurgy | Wrong hazard topology |
| Dyeing/mordanting | Wrong phase structure |

## What Remains

**Continuous closed-loop process control** characterized by:
- Ongoing monitoring (38% LINK)
- Intervention when needed (kernel operators)
- Hazard avoidance (17 forbidden transitions)
- State maintenance (convergence to STATE-C)

## Viable Process Classes (Tier 2)

1. Circulatory reflux distillation
2. Volatile aromatic extraction
3. Circulatory thermal conditioning

## Related Constraints

- C157 - Circulatory reflux uniquely compatible
- C175 - 3 process classes survive
- C177 - Both extraction/conditioning survive
