# C567: AX-Operational MIDDLE Sharing

**Tier:** 2 (Structural Inference)
**Phase:** AX_FUNCTIONAL_ANATOMY
**Scope:** Currier B grammar / vocabulary architecture
**Status:** VALIDATED (re-verified 2026-01-26 with 19 AX classes)

## Claim

AUXILIARY (AX) instruction classes use the same MIDDLEs as operational roles (EN, CC, FL, FQ). 71.9% of AX MIDDLEs are shared with at least one operational role, differentiated by PREFIX assignment.

## Evidence

- 57 unique MIDDLEs across 19 AX classes
- 56/57 (98.2%) are PP (Pipeline-Participating, shared with Currier A)
- 41/57 (71.9%) also appear in non-AX instruction classes
- AX-EN overlap: 36 MIDDLEs (Jaccard = 0.400)
- AX-FQ overlap: 19 MIDDLEs (Jaccard = 0.333)
- AX-FL overlap: 7 MIDDLEs (Jaccard = 0.123)
- AX-CC overlap: 6 MIDDLEs (Jaccard = 0.103)
- 16 MIDDLEs (28.1%) are AX-exclusive
- Of 41 shared MIDDLEs: 24 (58.5%) fully PREFIX-differentiated, 8 more ARTICULATOR-differentiated (total 78% differentiated)

## Interpretation

AX and operational roles draw from the same MIDDLE vocabulary. The PREFIX is the primary mechanism that assigns a token to AX versus an operational role. The same MIDDLE (e.g., "edy") becomes ENERGY when prefixed with ch/sh and becomes AUXILIARY when prefixed with ok/ot or articulated.
