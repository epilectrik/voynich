# C740: HT/UN Population Identity

**Tier:** 2
**Phase:** HT_RECONCILIATION
**Test:** T1
**Scope:** B

## Statement

The Human Track (HT) token population defined by exclusion from the 479-type classified grammar (C166) is identical to the Unclassified (UN) population characterized in C610-C621. Both comprise exactly 4,421 types and 7,042 occurrences. Type count delta = 0, occurrence count delta = 0.

## Evidence

| Metric | HT | UN | Delta |
|--------|----|----|-------|
| Types | 4,421 | 4,421 | 0 |
| Occurrences | 7,042 | 7,042 | 0 |
| Hapax | 3,274 | 3,274 | 0 |

Both populations are defined by the same exclusion criterion (not in 479-type grammar). Perfect identity confirms that all HT constraints (C166-C170, C341-C348, C404-C406, C450-C453, C507) and all UN constraints (C610-C621) describe the same set.

## Reconciliation

All older HT constraints and newer UN constraints can be referenced interchangeably. The term "HT" (Human Track) and "UN" (Unclassified) are synonyms.
