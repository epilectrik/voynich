# C479: Survivor-Set Discrimination Scaling

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Scope:** A+AZC+HT | **Source:** Phase SSD (2026-01-12)

---

## Statement

Larger AZC-admissible survivor sets correlate with increased HT morphological diversity (partial rho = 0.395, p < 10^-29, n=774, controlling for line length).

---

## Structural Interpretation

Survivor-set SIZE scales **discrimination responsibility**, not execution complexity.

- More admissible distinctions → broader discrimination envelope → more HT nuance required
- The correlation is with HT **morphology** (prefix entropy), not HT **density**
- This distinguishes "how much discriminative nuance to hold" from "how often to intervene"

---

## Evidence

```
Phase SSD Test 1 Results:
- Raw correlation: rho = 0.185, p < 0.0001
- Partial correlation (line length controlled): rho = 0.395, p = 2.4e-30
- n = 774 A lines with both survivors and HT tokens
- Effect size: STRONG
```

## Cross-References

| Constraint | Relationship |
|------------|--------------|
| C477 | **Extends**: HT correlates with tail pressure AND survivor-set size |
| C475 | **Explains**: 95.7% MIDDLE incompatibility creates highly discriminating survivor sets |
| C254 | **Compatible**: No grammar branching involved; discrimination layer only |
| C404-C405 | **Preserves**: HT remains non-operational |

---

## Does NOT Alter

- Grammar structure (C124)
- Hazard topology (C109)
- Execution logic (C171)
- HT non-operational status (C404-C405)
- B grammar (C254)

---

## Architectural Role

This constraint closes the last open gap in A→AZC→HT integration:

> **Survivor-set width is a discrimination envelope, and HT morphology scales with that envelope.**

The question "what does a large survivor set MEAN?" is now answered:

- NOT more execution steps
- NOT more procedures
- NOT more semantic content
- **YES**: broader discrimination responsibility absorbed by human operator
