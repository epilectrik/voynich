# C907: -hy Consonant Cluster Infrastructure

**Tier:** 4 | **Scope:** B | **Status:** OPEN (functionally uncharacterized)

---

## Statement

Tokens with `-hy` suffix form a **formulaic construction class** characterized by:
- Consonant cluster MIDDLEs (ck, ct, eck, ect, c, kc, tc)
- ch-/sh- prefix dominance (59% combined)
- Mid-line positioning (86%)

These are morphologically identified as **secondary infrastructure** but their procedural function remains unknown.

## Evidence

### Token Profile

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total -hy tokens | 910 (3.94% of B) |
| Line position | 86% MIDDLE, 8% LAST, 6% FIRST |
| Section distribution | Even (38% OTHER, 32% BIO, 30% HERBAL_B) |

### MIDDLE Distribution

| MIDDLE | Count | % of -hy |
|--------|-------|----------|
| ck | 194 | 21.3% |
| ct | 88 | 9.7% |
| eck | 87 | 9.6% |
| ect | 47 | 5.2% |
| c | 47 | 5.2% |

### PREFIX Distribution

| PREFIX | Count | % of -hy |
|--------|-------|----------|
| ch- | 338 | 37.1% |
| sh- | 198 | 21.8% |
| qo- | 101 | 11.1% |
| (none) | 91 | 10.0% |

### Most Common Tokens

| Token | Count | Structure |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| chckhy | 120 | ch + ck + hy |
| chcthy | 56 | ch + ct + hy |
| shckhy | 54 | sh + ck + hy |
| checkhy | 45 | ch + eck + hy |
| sheckhy | 35 | sh + eck + hy |

## Falsified Hypothesis

### Procedural Connector Hypothesis (REJECTED)

**Tested:** Whether -hy tokens mark boundaries between operational and infrastructure sequences.

**Method:** Transition enrichment analysis comparing -hy token contexts to baseline.

**Results:**
| Context | -hy Observed | Baseline | Enrichment |
|---------|--------------|----------|------------|
| OP ↔ OP | 24.3% | 27.7% | 0.88x |
| OP ↔ INFRA | 17.4% | 17.6% | 0.99x |

**Verdict:** No enrichment for boundary crossing. -hy tokens appear at OP↔INFRA boundaries at exactly baseline rate. **Connector hypothesis FALSIFIED.**

## Current Status

- **Morphologically characterized:** Formulaic ch/sh + consonant cluster + hy pattern
- **Functionally unknown:** No clear operational or boundary-marking role
- **Classification:** Secondary infrastructure (distinct from primary daiin-family infrastructure)

---

## Provenance

- **Phase:** MIDDLE_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS (2026-02-04)
- **Method:** Suffix-based filtering, transition enrichment analysis
- **Key Finding:** Formulaic pattern exists but functional role unclear

- C349.N349 (ck is NOT independent prefix family - related pattern)
- C376 (Suffix Kernel Dichotomy)
