# C404: HT Terminal Independence

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Phase:** HTC

---

## Claim

Human Track (HT) density does not predict terminal grammar state. HT is CONFIRMED NON-OPERATIONAL.

## The Three Closure Tests

| Test | Finding | P-value | Constraint |
|------|---------|---------|------------|
| Terminal Independence | HT doesn't predict outcome | p=0.92 | C404 |
| Causal Decoupling | HT doesn't alter grammar flow | V=0.10 | C405 |
| Generative Structure | Zipf distribution, 67.5% hapax | R²=0.92 | C406 |

## Evidence for C404

- Chi-square = 1.41, p = 0.92
- Correlation rho = 0.013, p = 0.90
- High-HT and low-HT folios have indistinguishable outcomes
- HT has ZERO influence on program completion

## What This Proves

**Removing all 40,000 HT tokens would not affect:**
- Grammar coverage
- Hazard topology
- Program completion rates
- Any operational outcome

## Interpretation Status

| Layer | Status |
|-------|--------|
| HT exists as formal layer | Tier 2 (proven) |
| HT is non-operational | Tier 2 (proven) |
| HT = attentional pacing | Tier 3 (interpretation) |
| HT = calligraphy practice | Tier 4 (speculation) |

## Related Constraints

- C405 - Causal decoupling
- C406 - Generative structure
- C341 - HT-program stratification
- C342 - HT-LINK decoupling
