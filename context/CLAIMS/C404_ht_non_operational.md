# C404: HT Terminal Independence

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED (evidence) / REVISED (interpretation) | **Phase:** HTC

---

## Claim

Human Track (HT) density does not predict terminal grammar state. HT is CONFIRMED OPERATIONALLY REDUNDANT.

> **Revision (2026-02-06):** Original claim said "NON-OPERATIONAL." Evidence (below) is unchanged.
> Reframed from "non-operational" to "operationally redundant" per C935 finding:
> HT tokens are compound operational tokens whose atoms appear as simple MIDDLEs
> in paragraph body lines (71.6% hit rate vs 59.2% random, 1.21x lift).
> Removing HT doesn't change outcomes because the body already encodes the same
> operations in simple form. This is redundancy, not absence of content.

## The Three Closure Tests

| Test | Finding | P-value | Constraint |
|------|---------|---------|------------|
| Terminal Independence | HT doesn't predict outcome | p=0.92 | C404 |
| Causal Decoupling | HT doesn't alter grammar flow | V=0.10 | C405 |
| Generative Structure | Zipf distribution, 67.5% hapax | R²=0.92 | C406 |

## Evidence for C404

- Chi-square = 1.41, p = 0.92
- Correlation rho = 0.013, p = 0.90
- High-HT and low-HT folios have indistinguishable outcomes
- HT has ZERO influence on program completion

**These results are UNCHANGED.** What changed is the explanation for WHY:

| Old interpretation | New interpretation |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| HT tokens have no operational content | HT tokens have operational content (compound MIDDLEs decompose to core atoms) |
| Removal is safe because HT is empty | Removal is safe because body lines already contain the same atoms in simple form |
| HT = identification layer separate from operations | HT = compound specification layer that is BOTH operational AND identifying |

## What This Proves

**Removing all HT tokens would not affect outcomes** — but NOT because they're empty.
They're redundant: the same operations are encoded in simpler tokens on body lines.

## Interpretation Status

| Layer | Status |
|-------|--------|
| HT exists as formal layer | Tier 2 (proven) |
| HT is operationally redundant | Tier 2 (proven, revised from "non-operational") |
| HT tokens are compound specifications | Tier 2 (C766 + C935) |
| HT = attentional pacing | ~~Tier 3~~ WEAKENED by C935 |
| HT = calligraphy practice | ~~Tier 4~~ WEAKENED by C935 |

## Related Constraints

- C405 - Causal decoupling
- C406 - Generative structure
- C341 - HT-program stratification
- C342 - HT-LINK decoupling
- C766 - UN = derived vocabulary (compound structure confirmed)
- C935 - Compound header tokens predict body content (NEW)
