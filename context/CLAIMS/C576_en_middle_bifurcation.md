# C576 - EN MIDDLE Vocabulary Bifurcation by Prefix

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Scope:** B

## Statement
QO-family uses 25 MIDDLEs, CHSH-family uses 43 MIDDLEs, with only 8 shared (Jaccard=0.133). PREFIX gates which MIDDLE subvocabulary is accessible, consistent with global PREFIX-MIDDLE binding (C276, C423). Despite distributional convergence (C574), the two prefix families operate on largely non-overlapping material vocabularies.

## Evidence
- QO MIDDLEs: 25
- CHSH MIDDLEs: 43
- Shared: 8 (Jaccard=0.133)
- EN-exclusive MIDDLEs: 30 (46.9% of EN vocabulary)
- Combined with C574: same function, different content

## Source
Phase: EN_ANATOMY (Script 1: en_census_and_inventory.py)

## Interpretation
This is a specific instantiation of C276 (MIDDLE is PREFIX-BOUND) and C423 (PREFIX-BOUND VOCABULARY DOMAINS, 80% exclusive MIDDLEs) operating within a single execution role. The PREFIX-MIDDLE binding documented globally persists within EN: PREFIX gates which subset of pipeline-derived materials is available for a given energy operation. C498.a partitions A MIDDLEs into PP/RI at the cross-system level; C576 partitions PP MIDDLEs within B execution by PREFIX channel. These are sequential filters in the A-to-B cascade.
