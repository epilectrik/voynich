# C945: No Folio-Persistent Rare MIDDLEs as Material Markers

**Tier:** 1 | **Status:** CLOSED (FALSIFIED) | **Scope:** B | **Source:** MATERIAL_LOCUS_SEARCH

## Statement

The hypothesis that rare MIDDLEs (<15 folios) persist across a folio's paragraphs as material markers is **rejected**. At the >80% paragraph persistence threshold, zero rare MIDDLEs qualify across all 59 eligible folios. Even at a relaxed >60% threshold, only 3 instances exist, with mean edit distance 1.33 from common MIDDLEs (2/3 are distance-1 operational variants). 81.8% of rare MIDDLE appearances are confined to a single paragraph.

## Evidence

### Persistence Distribution (2,162 rare-MIDDLE × eligible-folio pairs)

| Bucket | Count | Fraction |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 0-20% | 1,768 | 81.8% |
| 20-40% | 383 | 17.7% |
| 40-60% | 8 | 0.4% |
| 60-80% | 3 | 0.1% |
| 80-100% | 0 | 0.0% |

### Relaxed Threshold (>60%, n=3)

| MIDDLE | Folio | Distance to nearest common | Variant? |
|--------|-------|---------------------------|----------|
| lsh | f76r | 2 (from ckh) | Possible |
| ef | f40v | 1 (from e) | Yes |
| yt | f43r | 1 (from ct) | Yes |

## What This Rules Out

If materials were encoded as specific rare MIDDLEs, those MIDDLEs would need to persist across all operationally independent paragraphs of a folio (since all paragraphs on a folio presumably process the same material). The complete absence of this pattern rules out rare-MIDDLE-as-material-marker at any tested threshold.
