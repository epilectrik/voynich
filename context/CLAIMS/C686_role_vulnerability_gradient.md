# C686: Role Vulnerability Gradient

**Status:** VALIDATED | **Tier:** 2 | **Phase:** A_RECORD_B_FILTERING | **Scope:** A-B

## Finding

As PP MIDDLE count decreases, roles deplete in a consistent order: **FL first, then EN, AX, CC, FQ last**.

> **Aggregation Note (2026-01-30):** This constraint analyzes at line level (1,562 units).
> Per C881, A records are paragraphs (342 units). Per C885, the operational unit for
> A-B vocabulary correspondence is the A FOLIO (114 units, 81% coverage).

All roles remain technically present (>0% mean survival) even at the lowest PP bin (0-2), but FL drops to 2.3% survival. FQ is the most filtering-resistant role at every PP level.

## Role Survival by PP MIDDLE Count

| PP Bin | N | CC | EN | FL | FQ | AX |
|--------|---|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 0-2 | 87 | 7.5% | 3.8% | 2.3% | 13.5% | 5.3% |
| 3-5 | 633 | 13.5% | 14.0% | 7.1% | 32.9% | 16.0% |
| 6-8 | 673 | 20.4% | 25.8% | 14.0% | 50.1% | 26.7% |
| 9-11 | 136 | 25.2% | 37.3% | 27.0% | 65.6% | 36.6% |
| 12+ | 33 | 39.4% | 54.9% | 29.5% | 84.1% | 58.7% |

## Vulnerability Ordering (Most Fragile First)

1. **FL** (2.3% at 0-2 PP) — FLOW operators
2. **EN** (3.8%) — ENERGY operators
3. **AX** (5.3%) — AUXILIARY operators
4. **CC** (7.5%) — CORE CONTROL
5. **FQ** (13.5%) — FREQUENT operators (most resilient)

## Protected Roles

All 5 roles have >0% mean survival across all bins. No role is completely eliminated at any PP level.
