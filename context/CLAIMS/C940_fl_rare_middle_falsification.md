# C940: FL State Marking via Rare MIDDLEs FALSIFIED

**Tier:** 1 | **Status:** CLOSED (FALSIFIED) | **Scope:** B | **Source:** MIDDLE_MATERIAL_SEMANTICS

## Statement

Finish-zone-exclusive rare MIDDLEs show no significant enrichment for FL-characteristic characters ({a,d,i,l,m,n,o,r,y} per C777). FL char rate for finish-exclusive MIDDLEs (0.513) does not significantly differ from baseline (0.457): Mann-Whitney p=0.224, Cohen's d=0.178. The hypothesis that rare MIDDLEs in finish positions are extensions of the FL state index (C777) is **rejected**.

## Evidence

### FL Character Rate Comparison

| Group | N | Mean FL Rate | Median |
|-------|---|-------------|--------|
| Finish-exclusive | 38 | 0.513 | 0.500 |
| Setup-exclusive | 35 | 0.341 | 0.000 |
| Process-only | 135 | 0.446 | 0.333 |
| All MIDDLEs (baseline) | 1,225 | 0.457 | 0.429 |

### Statistical Tests

- Finish-exclusive vs ALL: U=24,944, p=0.224
- Chi-square (FL vs non-FL composition): chi2=0.109, p=0.741
- Cohen's d = 0.178 (negligible)

### Bimodal Distribution

The 38 finish-exclusive MIDDLEs split into two populations:
- **12 pure non-FL** (FL rate=0.0): ck, ckh, ckhh, eckh, ee, ek, h, ke, ksh, pch, s, tch — kernel/helper-dominated
- **15 pure FL** (FL rate=1.0): ai, aiin, ain, ar, i, iin, im, lo, m, o, ol, r, ry, y — known FL state markers

This bimodal split (rather than uniform FL enrichment) confirms that finish-zone vocabulary contains BOTH known FL markers AND non-FL operational MIDDLEs. The latter group is what kills the FL-state-marking explanation.

## What This Rules Out

The hypothesis: "Phase-exclusive vocabulary at folio ends reflects FL state indexing (C777), not material identity or operational phase-specificity."

This is rejected because:
1. Aggregate FL enrichment is not significant
2. Half of finish-exclusive MIDDLEs are kernel-bearing (non-FL)
3. The phase-exclusivity pattern has a procedural explanation independent of C777
