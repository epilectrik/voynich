# C994: B-Exclusive MIDDLEs Are Geometrically Subordinate

**Tier:** 2
**Scope:** A↔B
**Phase:** B_EXCLUSIVE_GEOMETRIC_INTEGRATION
**Status:** CONFIRMED (5/5 tests converge)

## Statement

The 900 B-exclusive MIDDLEs (appearing in Currier B but not in A's 972-MIDDLE discrimination space) are morphological elaboration tails of A's discrimination geometry, not an independent geometric system. They are subordinate extensions — compound superstrings built from A-space atoms, topologically compatible with A's manifold, and energetically invisible.

## Evidence

### T1: Residual Projection — SUBORDINATE
- 94.1% of B-exclusive MIDDLEs contain A-space atoms as substrings
- Projected norm ratio: 1.09 (within A's range)
- Distance to nearest A-point ratio: 1.24 (slightly farther, but on the same manifold)
- Max cosine similarity to nearest A-MIDDLE: 0.846 (strong alignment)
- 53/900 (5.9%) contain no A atoms — all are single-character or rare bigrams

### T2: Discrimination Fit — COMPATIBLE_TOPOLOGY
- B-exclusive neighbor enrichment: 33.3× above random for A-compatible pairs
- Internal density: 0.066× A's density (sparse but compatible)
- Clustering coefficient: 0.748 (86% of A's 0.873)
- B-exclusive co-occurrence respects A's compatibility boundaries

### T3: Role Distribution — MORPHOLOGICAL_TAIL
- Median frequency: 1 (80.2% are hapax legomena)
- 94.1% are compound (contain A-space atoms)
- 81% appear in a single folio only
- Mean length: 4.50 characters (vs shared mean 3.10)
- These are folio-specific, rare, long compound forms — the morphological periphery

### T4: Energy Sensitivity — SURFACE_ELABORATION
- Lines containing B-exclusive MIDDLEs: E = -0.0108
- Lines without: E = -0.0114
- Shift: +0.0006 (p = 0.12, not significant)
- Count correlation: ρ = +0.030 (p = 0.15)
- B-exclusive presence does NOT materially affect line-level energy

### T5: Sub-Component Collapse — FULL_COLLAPSE
- All A atoms (953): 94.1% contain atoms, 88.6% mean string coverage, 79.4% have ≥80% coverage
- Core A atoms (373, length 2-3): 94.1% contain atoms, 88.4% mean coverage
- Frequent A atoms (83, count ≥10): 85.3% contain atoms, 64.2% mean coverage
- Fully covered (≥99%): 665/900 (73.9%)
- Atom count distribution: 0→53, 1→126, 2→489, 3→182, 4→44, 5→6
- Most are 2-atom superstrings (54.3%)
- Top atoms: ed (7%), eed (4.1%), he (3.7%), aii (3.1%)

## Architectural Implication

The A→AZC→B geometric pipeline (C989) is not undermined by B-exclusive vocabulary. These 900 additional forms are compound elaborations of the same ~972 discrimination axes, appearing rarely and folio-specifically. They increase surface lexical diversity without adding geometric dimensionality.

The unified MIDDLE space is A's 972-type discrimination geometry. B uses it at 80% token concordance (C989), and the remaining 20% B-exclusive tokens are morphological tails of the same geometry.

## Relation to Existing Constraints
- **Confirms C610** (B-exclusive hapax rate >45% — actual 80.2%)
- **Confirms C618** (compound MIDDLE rate 94% for B-exclusive)
- **Confirms C619** (folio-specific MIDDLEs in B)
- **Extends C989** (B inhabits A's geometry — now including the exclusive tail)
- **Closes the gap** between 972 A-MIDDLEs and 1293 B-MIDDLEs: no second geometry needed
