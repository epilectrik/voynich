# C762 - Cross-System Single-Character Primitive Overlap

**Tier:** 2 | **Status:** CLOSED | **Scope:** GLOBAL

## Statement

Three folios - one from each system (Currier A, Currier B, AZC) - contain single-character sequences in margin/label positions. The 4 characters appearing in ALL THREE sequences (`d`, `k`, `o`, `r`) are all grammar primitives per C085.

## Data

| Folio | System | Placement | Character Set | Primitive Rate |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| f49v | Currier A | L (Label) | d, e, f, k, o, p, r, s, y | 67% (6/9) |
| f76r | Currier B | L (Label) | d, k, l, o, q, r, s | 86% (6/7) |
| f57v | AZC | R2 (Ring) | c, d, f, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, t, x, y | 54% (7/13) |

**Cross-system overlap:** `{d, k, o, r}` - all 4 are primitives
**Primitives NOT in overlap:** `{c, e, h, l, s, t}`

## Morphological Coverage

The 4 shared primitives span all token positions:
- `o` - PREFIX position (as in `qo-`, `-ol`)
- `k` - PREFIX and MIDDLE position (as in `-k-`, `ok-`)
- `d` - SUFFIX position (as in `-dy`, `-d`)
- `r` - SUFFIX position (as in `-r`, `-ar`, `-or`)

This means the cross-system overlap captures a complete PREFIX-MIDDLE-SUFFIX skeleton.

## Functional Interpretation

Per C497:
- **f49v** (Currier A): Instructional apparatus demonstrating morphology limits. Does NOT propagate into grammar.
- **f76r** (Currier B): Control-posture sentinels gating execution behavior. DOES propagate into grammar.
- **f57v R2** (AZC): Unknown function. Repeating sequence with asterisks (uncertain readings).

The shared primitive basis suggests:
1. f49v teaches the primitive alphabet (instructional use)
2. f76r uses primitives as operational markers (grammatical use)
3. f57v may encode using primitives (function unknown)
