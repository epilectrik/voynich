# C571: AX Functional Identity Resolution

**Tier:** 2 (Structural Inference)
**Phase:** AX_FUNCTIONAL_ANATOMY
**Scope:** Currier B grammar / AX interpretation

## Claim

AUXILIARY is the PREFIX-determined default deployment mode of pipeline vocabulary. AX is not an independent functional component -- it is the scaffold that emerges when MIDDLEs are paired with non-operational prefixes. PREFIX selects role; MIDDLE carries material.

## Evidence (synthesis of C567-C570)

1. **Same vocabulary material:** 72% of AX MIDDLEs are shared with operational roles (C567). 98% are PP (pipeline-participating). AX and EN draw from the same MIDDLE pool.

2. **PREFIX differentiates:** 89.6% of AX membership is predictable from PREFIX alone (C570). ch/sh/qo = operational; ok/ot = AX_MED scaffold; bare = AX_FINAL; articulated ch/sh = AX_INIT frame opener.

3. **Nearly universal in A:** 97.2% of A records carry AX vocabulary (C568). The top AX MIDDLEs are the simplest single-character forms (o, i, e, a, y). AX is built from the most basic vocabulary components.

4. **Proportional but structured:** AX fraction matches expected exactly (0.454 vs 0.455), but composition shows independent structure (R² = 0.83, not 0.9+) with subgroup asymmetry (C569).

5. **Always present:** 0 contexts produce zero AX classes. Classes 21, 22 (AX_FINAL) universally survive (C568).

## Functional Model

```
Pipeline provides MIDDLE (material identity)
    |
    +---> ch/sh/qo prefix ---> OPERATIONAL (EN/CC/FL/FQ)
    |     "Process this material"
    |
    +---> ok/ot prefix -------> AX_MED (scaffold)
    |     "Stage this material"
    |
    +---> bare (no prefix) ---> AX_FINAL (frame closer)
    |     "Material is ready"
    |
    +---> articulated ch/sh --> AX_INIT (frame opener)
          "Open frame with this material"
```

## What AX IS

AX is the execution scaffold built from the same material vocabulary as operations. It is:
- **Material-conditioned:** Different A records produce different AX vocabulary (via PP MIDDLEs)
- **PREFIX-determined:** The prefix, not the MIDDLE, assigns scaffold vs operational role
- **Structurally guaranteed:** Universal MIDDLEs ensure AX is always available
- **Proportionally scaled:** AX volume tracks total pipeline throughput

## What AX is NOT

- NOT an independent vocabulary (72% shared MIDDLEs)
- NOT a separate pipeline track (98% PP, same source as operational)
- NOT a pure byproduct (R² = 0.83, subgroup asymmetry exists)
- NOT optional (0 zero-AX contexts)
