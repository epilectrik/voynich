# C802: Body HT LINK Proximity

## Constraint

Body HT clusters near LINK tokens. Mean distance to nearest LINK: HT = 2.53 tokens, non-HT = 3.08 tokens (Mann-Whitney p < 0.0001).

Body HT does NOT cluster near FL tokens. Mean distance to nearest FL: HT = 4.04 tokens, non-HT = 3.82 tokens (p = 0.056, NS).

## Evidence

LINK proximity:
- HT mean distance: 2.53 tokens
- Non-HT mean distance: 3.08 tokens
- Mann-Whitney: p < 0.0001

FL proximity:
- HT mean distance: 4.04 tokens
- Non-HT mean distance: 3.82 tokens
- Mann-Whitney: p = 0.0564 (NS)

## Interpretation

HT marks "waiting/monitoring zones" around LINK operators rather than clustering at escape points. This reconciles C796 (folio-level escape correlation) with C341 (HT-LINK association): high-escape folios have more monitoring checkpoints, and HT appears at those checkpoints.
