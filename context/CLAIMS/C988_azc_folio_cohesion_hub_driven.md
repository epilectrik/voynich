# C988: AZC Folio Cohesion Is Hub-Driven

**Tier:** 2 | **Scope:** AZC | **Phase:** DISCRIMINATION_SPACE_DERIVATION

## Statement

AZC folio MIDDLEs are highly coherent in the full 100D discrimination space (27/27 folios coherent at z > 2.0, mean cos_z = +13.26), but this cohesion is entirely hub-driven: after removing λ₁, 0/27 folios show coherence in the residual space (mean cos_z = -2.68). AZC folios sample coherent frequency-tier slices of the MIDDLE inventory while maintaining diverse residual positions. Zone progression (C→R→S) traces accelerating divergence along the hub axis.

## Evidence

### Folio Cohesion: Full vs Residual (T10 + T11)

| Metric | Full Embedding | Residual Embedding |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Folios coherent (z > 2.0) | 27/27 (100%) | 0/27 (0%) |
| Mean cosine z-score | +13.26 | -2.68 |
| Interfolio cosine | 0.9475 | 0.216 |
| Section within/between ratio | 0.944 (p=0.0006) | 0.937 (p=0.0003) |

### Zone Trajectory (T10)

| Transition | Cumulative Distance | Cosine to C-Centroid |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| C → R1 | 0.50 | 0.998 |
| R1 → R2 | 0.70 | 0.997 |
| R2 → R3 | 0.85 | 0.992 |
| R3 → S1 | 0.87 | 0.988 |
| S1 → S2 | 0.87 | 0.988 |

Accelerating distance divergence with near-parallel cosine direction = movement along hub gradient, not perpendicular diversification.

### Section Structure (T10 + T11)

| Section | Folios | Character |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Z (Zodiac) | 12 | Largest, most internally coherent |
| A (Astronomical) | 8 | Mid-range diversity |
| C (Cosmological) | 7 | Distinct cluster in full space |

Section structure is real but weak (ratio 0.94, p < 0.001). Cluster-section alignment is near zero (ARI=0.009, NMI=0.017).

### Interpretation

1. AZC folios are NOT sampling distinct subregions of the constraint manifold
2. Instead, each folio samples a **frequency-coherent slice** — similar hub loadings, diverse residual positions
3. This is consistent with C476 (coverage optimization): each folio optimizes coverage of a frequency tier
4. Zone progression (C→R→S) moves along the hub gradient (frequency/centrality decreasing) — consistent with C443 (escape rate decreasing C→R→S)
5. Residual diversity within folios means AZC positions diversify constraint content while maintaining frequency coherence

## Provenance

- T10 (AZC submanifold projection), T11 (hub-residual structure)
- Extends C472 (71.8% of AZC MIDDLEs are folio-specific) — specificity is frequency-tier, not constraint-region
- Consistent with C443 (escape gradient C→R→S) mapped onto hub gradient
- Related: C476 (coverage optimization), C941 (section as vocabulary organizer)
