# Frozen Conclusion (Tier 0)

**Status:** FROZEN | **Tier:** 0 | **Scope:** Currier B only

## The Core Finding

> **The Voynich Manuscript's Currier B text encodes a family of closed-loop, kernel-centric control programs designed to maintain a system within a narrow viability regime, governed by a single shared grammar.**

This conclusion is proven by the internal structure of the text alone. It requires no external interpretation and cannot be overturned by speculation.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Instruction classes | 49 | 9.8x compression from 479 token types |
| Grammar coverage | 100% | Every token in Currier B parses |
| Folios enumerated | 83 | Each folio is a complete program |
| Instructions cataloged | 75,248 | Total executable content |
| Translation-eligible zones | 0 | Pure operational, no referents |
| Forbidden transitions | 17 | In 5 hazard classes |
| LINK density | 38% | Deliberate waiting/monitoring |

## What "Closed-Loop Control Program" Means

### Closed-Loop
The system monitors its own state and adjusts based on feedback. Programs don't run blind—they respond to conditions.

### Kernel-Centric
Three operators (k, h, e) form the control core:
- **k** = ENERGY_MODULATOR (adjust energy input)
- **h** = PHASE_MANAGER (manage phase transitions)
- **e** = STABILITY_ANCHOR (maintain stable state, 54.7% of recovery paths)

### Narrow Viability Regime
The system operates within tight bounds. 17 transitions are absolutely forbidden—crossing these boundaries causes failure.

### Single Shared Grammar
All 83 programs use the same 49 instruction classes. There are no dialects, variants, or exceptions. The grammar is universal.

## Scope Limitation

**This conclusion applies to Currier B only.**

- Currier B = 61.9% of tokens, 83 folios
- Currier A (30.5%) is a different system (categorical registry)
- AZC (7.7%) is a hybrid (diagram annotation)

## How This Was Proven

The frozen conclusion rests on these structural facts:

1. **Grammar closure** (Phase 20): 479 token types reduce to 49 classes with 0 loss
2. **100% coverage** (Phase 21): Every Currier B token parses
3. **Forbidden topology** (Phase 18): 17 specific transitions never occur (0 violations)
4. **Kernel dominance** (Phase 15): k, h, e form a control core that no surrogate reproduced
5. **Convergence** (Phase 13-14): 57.8% of programs terminate in STATE-C
6. **Folio = program** (Phase 22): Each folio is complete and self-contained

These are structural facts, not interpretations. Any analyst examining the token sequences will find the same patterns.

## What This Is NOT

- **NOT a translation** - tokens don't mean words
- **NOT a recipe book** - no ingredient lists, no quantities
- **NOT a language** - 0.19% reference rate (Phase X.5)
- **NOT a cipher** - transforms decrease mutual information
- **NOT illustration-dependent** - swap invariance p=1.0

See [falsifications.md](falsifications.md) for complete rejection list.

## Purpose Class

The only surviving purpose class is:

> **Continuous closed-loop process control**

All other purpose classes were eliminated by structural incompatibility:
- Cipher/hoax, Encoded language, Recipe/pharmacology
- Herbarium/taxonomy, Medical procedure, Astronomical calculation
- Ritual/symbolic practice, Educational text, Discrete batch operations
