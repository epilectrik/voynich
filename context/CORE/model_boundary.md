## What the Manuscript DOES Encode (Proven)

### Currier B (61.9% of tokens, 83 folios)

| Layer | Content | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Executable Grammar** | 49 instruction classes, 100% coverage | Phase 20: 9.8x compression |
| **Kernel Control** | 3 operators (k, h, e) with mandatory STATE-C | Phase 15: 0/100 surrogates reproduced |
| **Hazard Topology** | 17 forbidden transitions in 5 failure classes | Phase 18 |
| **Convergence** | Dominant convergence to STATE-C (57.8% terminal) | Phase 13-14, SEL-F |
| **LINK Operator** | Deliberate non-intervention (38% of text) | Phase 16: external termination |
| **Folio = Program** | Each folio is complete, self-contained | Phase 22: 83 folios enumerated |
| **Line = Micro-stage** | Lines are formal control blocks (3.3x more regular than random) | Phase LINE |

### Currier A (30.5% of tokens, 114 folios)

| Layer | Content | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Non-sequential registry** | Categorical entries, not executable programs | Phase CAS |
| **Marker system** | 8+ mutually exclusive prefix families | Phase CAS |
| **Multiplicity encoding** | Literal repetition (64.1% show `[BLOCK] × N`) | Phase CAS-MULT |
| **Compositional morphology** | PREFIX + MIDDLE + SUFFIX structure | Phase CAS-MORPH |
| **Section isolation** | 100% section-exclusive blocks | Phase CAS-DEEP |

### AZC (7.7% of tokens, 30 folios)

| Layer | Content | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Hybrid mode** | Bridges A and B vocabulary (60.5% shared) | Phase AZC |
| **Placement coding** | Finite placement classes (C, P, R1-R3, S-S2, Y) | Phase AZC-PLACEMENT |
| **Diagram anchoring** | Tokens are position-locked to diagram features | Phase AZC-AXIS |

## What the Manuscript DOES NOT Encode (Proven)

| Claim | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Language** | FALSIFIED | Phase X.5: 0.19% reference rate |
| **Cipher** | FALSIFIED | Phase G: transforms DECREASE MI |
| **Glyph Semantics** | FALSIFIED | Phase 19: 0 identifier tokens |
| **Illustration-Dependent Logic** | FALSIFIED | Phase ILL: swap invariance p=1.0 |
| **Step-by-Step Recipe** | FALSIFIED | Phase FSS: families are emergent |
| **Material Encoding** | FALSIFIED | Pure operational, 0 referent tokens |
| **Ingredient Lists** | FALSIFIED | No quantities, no materials |

## What the Operator Provides (Not Encoded)

The text assumes an expert operator who brings:

| Knowledge | Why Not Encoded |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Sensory completion judgment** | "When to stop" requires physical observation |
| **Material selection** | "What to process" is external to the control system |
| **Hazard recognition** | Physical signs (smoke, overflow) can't be encoded |
| **Process initiation** | Text assumes operator is already at the apparatus |
| **Equipment setup** | Physical configuration is tacit knowledge |

This is **consistent with a reference manual**, not a teaching text.

## What the Text Provides

| Information | How Encoded |
|-------------|-------------|
| **WHERE in the sequence** | Position in token stream |
| **WHAT to do at each step** | Instruction class (49 types) |
| **What NOT to do** | Forbidden transitions (17 specific) |
| **When to wait** | LINK tokens (38% of text) |
| **Program organization** | Folio = complete program, Line = control block |

## Scope Boundaries

### Inside Scope (Recoverable Internally)
- Grammar structure and rules
- Transition patterns and constraints
- Token classification and roles
- Program organization and flow
- Hazard topology

### Outside Scope (Requires External Evidence)
- Specific substances or products
- Natural language equivalents
- Author identity or school
- Dating or geographic origin
- Illustration meanings
- Apparatus construction details

**Rule:** Claims about outside-scope topics belong to Tier 3-4.

## The Three Systems

| System | Function | Relationship |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Currier B** | Sequential executable programs | Primary control content |
| **Currier A** | Non-sequential categorical registry | Parts catalog / index |
| **AZC** | Hybrid diagram annotation | Labeling / position marking |

- A and B are **folio-disjoint** (0 shared folios)
- A and B are **grammar-disjoint** (different formal systems)
- A, B, and AZC are **vocabulary-integrated** (shared type system)

See [../ARCHITECTURE/cross_system.md](../ARCHITECTURE/cross_system.md) for details.
