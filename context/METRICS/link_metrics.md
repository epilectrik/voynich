# LINK Metrics

**Status:** CLOSED | **Tier:** 2

---

## Overall LINK Density

| System | LINK Density |
|--------|--------------|
| Currier B | 13.2% (3,047/23,096) |
| Currier A | 3.0% |
| AZC | 7.6% (highest) |

> **C609 Correction:** Previous values of "6.6%" and "38% (weighted by folio)" were legacy figures with undocumented methodology. Reconciliation audit (Phase LINK_DENSITY_RECONCILIATION) established true B density at 13.2% token-level, 12.5% folio mean. No aggregation reproduces 38%.

## LINK by Section (C334)

| Section | LINK Density | Relative |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| B | 19.6% | 1.45x baseline |
| H | 9.1% | Baseline |
| C | 10.1% | ~Baseline |
| S | 9.8% | ~Baseline |

Section B requires 45% more waiting.

## LINK Distribution Properties (C365)

| Property | Value | p-value |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Spatial uniformity | YES | 0.005 |
| Run length | Random | z=0.14 |
| Line-position | Uniform | 0.80 |
| Positional clustering | NO | - |

LINK has **no positional marking function**.

## LINK Context (C366)

### Preceding LINK
| Role | Enrichment |
|------|------------|
| AUXILIARY | 1.50x |
| FLOW_OPERATOR | 1.30x |

### Following LINK
| Role | Enrichment |
|------|------------|
| HIGH_IMPACT | 2.70x |
| ENERGY_OPERATOR | 1.15x |

LINK marks **boundary between monitoring and intervention**.

## LINK-CEI Relationship (C190)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Correlation | r = -0.7057 |
| Direction | Strong negative |
| Meaning | More LINK → Less engagement |

---

## LINK at Boundaries (C359)

| Position | LINK Presence |
|----------|---------------|
| Line boundaries | 0.60x (suppressed) |
| Mid-line | 1.0x (baseline) |

Lines are NOT pause points.

---

## LINK-Escalation Complementarity (C340)

| Context | LINK Density |
|---------|--------------|
| Near escalation (k/h) | 0.605x |
| Baseline | 1.0x |

Waiting and intervention are functionally segregated.
