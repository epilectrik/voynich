# MODEL_CONTEXT.md

**Version:** 2.13 | **Date:** 2026-01-10 | **Status:** FROZEN

This document explains how to read and interpret the constraint system. It does not duplicate constraints. It provides the architectural lens, epistemic governance, and integration logic required to understand them as a coherent model.

## I. PROJECT IDENTITY & CLAIM BOUNDARY

### Core Identity Statement

The Voynich Manuscript is a **designed, non-semantic, multi-layer control artifact**.

It is:
- A family of closed-loop control programs (Currier B)
- A complexity-frontier registry (Currier A)
- A placement-coded hybrid workflow system (AZC)
- A human-pacing layer (HT)

It is definitively NOT:
- A language (natural or constructed)
- A cipher or encoding of language
- A semantic symbol system
- A referential text with recoverable meaning

### Token Status

Tokens are **instructional roles**, not symbols. They encode functional position within a grammar, not concepts or referents. The same token in different systems (A vs B) performs different structural functions.

Meaning exists only in **external human practice** - the operator's trained judgment when executing procedures. The manuscript provides structure; the operator supplies semantics.

### Recoverability Boundary

**Internally recoverable:** Grammar, structure, transition rules, morphological composition, operational metrics, system boundaries.

**Externally plausible:** Process domain (distillation, perfumery), institutional context (guild workshop), historical period.

**Irrecoverable:** Specific substances, recipes, token meanings, apparatus schematics, names, dates.

## II. EPISTEMIC GOVERNANCE

### Tier Framework

| Tier | Status | Meaning | Revisability |
|------|--------|---------|--------------|
| 0 | FROZEN | Established structural fact | Cannot be revised |
| 1 | FALSIFIED | Hypothesis rejected with evidence | Preserved as negative knowledge |
| 2 | ESTABLISHED | Validated finding | Can be refined with new evidence |
| 3 | SPECULATIVE | Conditional interpretation | Non-binding, clearly labeled |
| 4 | EXPLORATORY | Under investigation | May be promoted or discarded |

### Binding Rule

**Only Tier 0-2 constrain the model.** Tier 3-4 content is preserved for context but does not restrict future analysis.

### Falsification Meaning

"Falsified" means a hypothesis was tested and rejected with statistical evidence. Falsified hypotheses are preserved because:
- They prevent re-derivation of dead ends
- They document what the manuscript is NOT
- They constrain the space of valid interpretations

Discarded hypotheses are **negative knowledge** - as valuable as positive findings.

## III. MODEL FREEZE & STOP CONDITIONS

### Closed Components

The following are **structurally closed** and cannot be reopened without extraordinary evidence:

| Component | Status | Implication |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Currier B grammar | CLOSED | 49-class system is final |
| Currier A grammar | CLOSED (NONE) | A has no sequential grammar |
| Morphological axes | CLOSED | PREFIX/MIDDLE/SUFFIX decomposition is fixed |
| System boundaries | CLOSED | A/B/AZC/HT separation is designed |
| Language hypothesis | CLOSED | Definitively rejected |
| Cipher hypothesis | CLOSED | Definitively rejected |

### Permitted Future Work

- Visualization and UI improvements
- Documentation and consolidation
- Historical analogy exploration (Tier 3+)
- Cross-manuscript comparison
- Operator-practice reconstruction (speculative)

### Forbidden Without Model Reopening

- New grammar proposals for any system
- New morphological decomposition schemes
- Claims of semantic token meaning
- Entry-level A-B correspondence claims
- Reintroduction of language/cipher hypotheses

## IV. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

The Voynich Manuscript contains four coexisting systems sharing a morphological type space but operating under different structural regimes:

| System | Mode | Function | Executes? | Grammar? |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Currier B | Sequential | Closed-loop control programs | Yes | 49-class |
| Currier A | Non-sequential | Complexity-frontier registry | No | None |
| AZC | Placement-coded | Context-gated workflow | Hybrid | Positional |
| Human Track | Distributed | Non-operational human pacing | No | Statistical |

### Critical Distinctions

**Same alphabet ≠ same grammar.** All systems use the same character set and morphological components, but grammatical rules differ completely between A and B.

**Shared type system ≠ shared semantics.** The global morphological type system (C383) provides structural consistency without implying that tokens "mean" the same thing across systems.

**Vocabulary sharing ≠ lookup.** A and B share ~1,500 token types because they describe the same operational domain, not because A entries "refer to" B programs.

### Four-Layer Responsibility Model (v2.13)

The manuscript distributes responsibility between system and human across four layers:

| Layer | Role | What It Handles |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| **Currier B** | Constrains you | Execution grammar, safety envelope |
| **Currier A** | Discriminates for you | Fine distinctions at complexity frontier |
| **AZC** | Orients you | Spatial scaffold, attention mode |
| **HT** | Prepares you | Anticipatory vigilance signal |

The right mental model is not "What does this page tell me to do?" but:

> **"How much of the problem is the system handling for me here, and how much vigilance am I responsible for?"**

### Design Freedom vs Constraint (C458)

B programs exhibit **asymmetric design freedom**:

| Dimension | Allowed to Vary? | Evidence |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Hazard exposure | NO | CV = 0.11 (clamped) |
| Intervention diversity | NO | CV = 0.04 (clamped) |
| Recovery operations | YES | CV = 0.82 (free) |
| Near-miss handling | YES | CV = 0.72 (free) |

**Risk is globally constrained; recovery strategy is locally variable.**

---

## V. GLOBAL MORPHOLOGICAL TYPE SYSTEM

Constraint C383 establishes a global type system spanning all Voynich systems. Understanding it correctly prevents catastrophic misreadings.

### Prefix Function

Prefixes encode **functional type**, not semantic category:
- 8 marker families (ch, sh, ok, ot, da, qo, ol, ct)
- Kernel-heavy vs kernel-light distinction is GLOBAL
- Sister pairs (ch/sh, ok/ot) are **equivalent slots**, not different concepts

### MIDDLE Function

MIDDLEs are the primary vocabulary layer:
- 1,184 distinct MIDDLEs identified
- 80% are prefix-exclusive (domain-specific)
- 20% are shared across prefixes
- 27 universal MIDDLEs appear in 6+ prefix classes

### SUFFIX Function

Suffixes encode universal form markers:
- 22/25 significant suffixes appear across 6+ prefix classes
- Suffix selection is compositionally conditioned
- Suffixes do not carry semantic content

### Infrastructure Tokens

DA-family tokens are **infrastructural**:
- Same role in A, B, and AZC
- Mark internal articulation boundaries
- Do not encode category identity
- Function as punctuation, not classification

---

## VI. CURRIER B - EXECUTABLE CONTROL LOGIC

Currier B (61.9% of tokens, 83 folios) encodes executable control programs. This section explains the structural synthesis, not individual constraints.

### Closed-Loop Process Control

Programs maintain a system within a narrow viability regime through continuous feedback. They are NOT:
- Batch recipes (do X, then Y, then Z)
- Decision trees (if X then Y)
- State machines (discrete transitions)

They ARE:
- Continuous monitoring loops
- Gradient-following trajectories
- Convergence-seeking procedures

### LINK Operators

LINK tokens mark **attention points**, not interventions:
- Operator observes but does not act
- System continues autonomously
- LINK density inversely correlates with control intensity

### Hazard Topology

17 forbidden transitions define hazard space:
- 5 failure classes (PHASE_ORDERING dominant at 41%)
- Hazards are grammatically forbidden, not semantically labeled
- Programs avoid hazards through grammar, not warnings

### Convergence vs Termination

57.8% of programs terminate in STATE-C (stable convergent):
- Convergence is structural (grammar reaches absorbing state)
- Termination is physical (operator ends session)
- These are independent

### Time-Reversal Symmetry

Grammar is symmetric under time reversal (C391):
- No privileged direction
- Consistent with continuous process (not narrative)
- Supports circulatory/reflux interpretation

### Operator Role

The manuscript provides **structure**; the operator supplies **meaning**:
- Programs assume expert judgment
- No explanations, only instructions
- Designed for practitioners, not novices

---

## VII. CURRIER A - FINAL INTERPRETATION

Currier A (13.6% coverage under B grammar) is structurally distinct. The Complexity-Frontier Registry (CFR) interpretation is the strongest surviving model.

### What Currier A Does NOT Have

- Sequential grammar (transitions are non-deterministic)
- Execution semantics (entries are not programs)
- Lookup behavior (no entry-level A-B coupling)
- Hierarchical organization (flat registry)
- Semantic categories (prefixes are markers, not types)

### Complexity-Frontier Registry (CFR) Model

Currier A externalizes regions of a shared control-space where operational similarity breaks down and fine discrimination is required.

Equivalently described as:
- A *variant discrimination registry* (craft view)
- A *partitioning of continuous control space* (formal view)

### Why Failure-Memory Was Rejected

Initial A-B hazard correlation (rho=0.228, p=0.038) was tested:
- Permutation control: p=0.111 (FAILED)
- Frequency-matched control: p=0.056 (FAILED)
- Pre-registered low-frequency MIDDLE test: p=0.651 (FAIL)

**Conclusion:** Apparent correlation was entirely driven by token frequency. High-frequency tokens appear in complex structures in both systems. When frequency is controlled, no residual signal exists.

**Currier A is complexity-aligned, not risk-encoding.**

### Clustering Structure

31% of adjacent A entries share vocabulary (clustered); 69% do not (singletons):
- Mean cluster size: 3 entries (range 2-20)
- Autocorrelation r=0.80
- 68% vocabulary divergence between populations
- No hierarchy, headers, or group boundaries

Clustering reflects **where distinctions matter**, not categorical organization.

### Multiplicity Encoding

64.1% of entries show bounded repetition (2-6x):
- Repetition is literal enumeration, not quantity encoding
- No arithmetic across entries
- Blocks are 100% unique (no cross-entry reuse)

---

## VIII. AZC - HYBRID MODE & PLACEMENT CODING

AZC (9,401 tokens, 7.7% of corpus) is neither Currier A nor Currier B. It operates under a hybrid regime with placement-based constraints.

### Hybrid Status

- 69.7% B-legal transitions
- 65.4% A-legal transitions
- Neither grammar fully applies

### Placement Coding

Position on the page constrains legality:
- R/R1/R2/R3: Radial positions
- S/S1/S2: Sector positions
- C: Central
- MULTI: Multiple placements

Position determines **what is legal**, not **what it means**.

### Diagram Function

Diagrams anchor legality constraints but do not carry semantic content:
- Physical layout gates grammatical options
- Illustrations are structurally relevant but not interpretively meaningful
- "Season-gated workflow" is structural, not calendrical

### AZC Entry Orientation (C460)

AZC folios mark natural HT transition zones in the manuscript:
- HT is elevated **before** AZC pages, reduced **after** them
- This pattern resembles random positions more than A or B entries
- AZC is **placed at** natural HT transitions, not **causing** them

AZC functions as an **orientation marker** at cognitively meaningful boundaries, not as a procedural entry point.

### Interpretive Bounds

Claims about celestial, calendrical, or geographical meaning are Tier 3+ (non-binding). The structural finding is placement-coding; interpretation is speculative.

---

## IX. HUMAN TRACK (HT) - STATUS & INTERPRETIVE BOUNDS

Human Track tokens form a distinct layer with specific structural properties. Interpretation must respect the tier boundary.

### Core Understanding (v2.13)

> **HT is a scalar signal of required human vigilance that varies with content characteristics, not with codicology, singular hazards, or execution failure modes.**

HT functions as **anticipatory vigilance** - it prepares the human operator for upcoming demands rather than reacting to past events.

### Tier 2 (Structural, Binding)

These findings constrain the model:

- HT is **non-operational** (terminal independence p=0.92)
- HT has **causal decoupling** from program execution (V=0.10)
- HT exhibits **generative structure** (Zipf=0.89)
- HT **avoids hazards entirely** (0/35 forbidden seam presence)
- HT **synchronizes statistically** with preceding grammar phase
- HT removal **does not affect execution** outcomes
- HT **anticipates B stress** at quire level (r=0.343, p=0.0015) - C459
- HT is **content-driven**, not production-driven (no quire boundary alignment)
- HT is **front-loaded** in the manuscript (global decreasing trend)

### Key Properties (v2.13 Refinement)

- HT does **not** say *why* attention is needed
- HT does **not** isolate catastrophic cases
- HT does **not** encode "danger zones"
- HT is **coarse**, distributed, and probabilistic
- HT marks situations where the system expects the human to stay mentally engaged

### Tier 3-4 (Interpretive, Non-Binding)

These interpretations are plausible but not constraining:

**Dual-Purpose Attention Mechanism:**
1. Maintained operator attention/alertness during waiting phases
2. Trained guild members in the art of the written form

This is NOT "doodling" or "scribbling" - the evidence (3.29x rare grapheme engagement, 28.5% boundary-pushing forms, systematic family rotation) shows deliberate skill acquisition that doubles as attention maintenance.

**Mark this distinction clearly:** Structural findings are facts; interpretations are hypotheses.

### System-Specific HT Behavior

| System | HT Anchoring Pressure |
|--------|----------------------|
| Currier A | Registry layout (entry boundaries) |
| Currier B | Temporal/attentional context |
| AZC | Diagram geometry (label positions) |

Same layer, different structural pressures.

---

## X. CROSS-SYSTEM INTEGRATION LOGIC

The four systems coexist without semantic coupling. Understanding their relationships prevents the most common misinterpretations.

### A-B Relationship

- **Statistical and global only** - vocabulary overlap exists at population level
- **No addressable mapping** - no A entry "refers to" any B program
- **Complexity alignment** - shared vocabulary reflects shared operational domain
- **NOT risk encoding** - correlation with hazard is spurious (frequency-driven)

The correct model:
> Currier B provides sequences (how to act).
> Currier A provides discrimination (where fine distinctions matter).

### A-AZC Relationship

- Vocabulary persistence across systems
- Placement constraints in AZC may gate A-vocabulary availability
- No direct execution relationship

### HT-A Relationship

- HT shows positional specialization in A (entry-aligned, seam-avoiding)
- Different anchoring pressure than HT in B
- Statistical coupling, not functional dependency

### What This Means

The systems share a **type space** but not **semantics**:
- Same morphological components
- Same character inventory
- Different grammatical regimes
- Different functional roles

## XI. REJECTED / FALSIFIED THEORIES

The following hypotheses have been tested and rejected. They are preserved as negative knowledge.

| Hypothesis | Status | Key Evidence |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| Natural language | FALSIFIED | 0.19% reference rate, no syntax |
| Cipher | FALSIFIED | No decryption yields language |
| Constructed language | FALSIFIED | No generative grammar |
| Ingredient lists | FALSIFIED | Repetition ≠ quantity (EXT-9B) |
| Ratio encoding | FALSIFIED | No arithmetic across entries |
| Hazard registry | FALSIFIED | Pre-registered test p=0.651 |
| Semantic diagrams | FALSIFIED | Swap invariance p=1.0 |
| Operator error logging | FALSIFIED | No error patterns |
| Entry-level A-B correspondence | FALSIFIED | C384, no coupling |

**Do not resurrect these hypotheses** without extraordinary new evidence and explicit model reopening.

---

## XII. HISTORICAL & CRAFT ALIGNMENTS (NON-BINDING)

The following interpretations are **plausible but do not constrain the model**:

### Process Domain

- **Reflux distillation** (circulatory alembic) - uniquely compatible with grammar (100%)
- **Perfumery/botanical extraction** - favored by 8/8 diagnostic tests
- **Hybrid hazard model** - 71% batch, 29% apparatus failure modes

### Institutional Context

- **Guild workshop** - expert-oriented, no novice accommodation
- **Master-practitioner reference** - assumes trained judgment
- **Working manual** - not teaching text

### Historical Plausibility

- Medieval/early modern craft practice
- European workshop tradition
- Pre-modern process control

**These do not constrain the model.** They provide interpretive context only.

---

## XIII. METHODOLOGICAL WARNINGS & FAILURE MODES

Common errors when reading constraints:

### Prefix vs Token Confusion

Prefixes are **functional markers**, not semantic categories. "ch-" tokens are not "about" something different than "sh-" tokens. Sister pairs are equivalent slots.

### Over-Interpreting Placement

AZC placement codes constrain **legality**, not meaning. Position on page determines what grammar allows, not what content signifies.

### Treating HT as Annotation

HT is NOT commentary, labeling, or explanation. It is a statistically coupled but operationally independent layer. HT tokens do not "annotate" adjacent content.

### Treating A as Lookup Table

Currier A entries do NOT map to B programs. There is no addressable correspondence. Vocabulary sharing is statistical, not referential.

### Forgetting Section Isolation

Sections (H, P, T for A; quire-aligned for B) are strong boundaries. Cross-section patterns may be artifacts. Always control for section.

### Semantic Back-Sliding

The strongest temptation is to assign meaning to tokens. Resist this. Tokens have **roles**, not meanings. Semantics exist only in operator practice.

---

## XIV. WHAT CANNOT BE RECOVERED

The following are **definitively irrecoverable** from the manuscript alone:

- Specific substances (plants, minerals, compounds)
- Recipes or formulations
- Token meanings or referents
- Apparatus schematics or designs
- Personal or place names
- Dates or calendar systems
- Geographic information
- Authorial identity

External evidence (historical documents, archaeological finds) might constrain these. Internal analysis cannot.

---

## XV. HOW TO READ THE CONSTRAINTS

### Layered Access (Recommended)

**Do NOT read CONSTRAINT_TABLE.txt in full.** Use the layered system:

1. **Understand architecture first** - Read this document (MODEL_CONTEXT.md)
2. **Find by topic** - Use CLAIMS/INDEX.md to browse categories
3. **Get details** - Follow links to grouped registry files (currier_a.md, etc.)
4. **Specific lookup** - Ctrl+F for "C###" in INDEX.md or registries

### Programmatic Access

CONSTRAINT_TABLE.txt is for **scripts and validation tools only**:
- Constraint validator hooks
- Automated audits
- Cross-reference checking

Format is tab-separated with fields:
- NUM: Constraint number (C###)
- CONSTRAINT: Brief description
- TIER: Epistemic status (0-4)
- SCOPE: System applicability (A/B/AZC/HT/GLOBAL)
- LOCATION: File reference (-> = individual file, in: = grouped registry)

### Reading Rules

1. **Constraints are atomic** - each stands alone
2. **Some supersede others** - later constraints may refine earlier ones
3. **Revisions are explicit** - refinements noted with .a, .b suffixes
4. **Tier labels matter more than numbering** - a Tier 0 constraint outranks any Tier 2
5. **Gaps in numbering ≠ missing content** - numbers are assigned chronologically

### Grouped Registries

Many constraints are documented in grouped files:
- tier0_core.md - Frozen Tier 0 facts
- grammar_system.md - B grammar structure
- currier_a.md - A registry properties
- morphology.md - Compositional system
- operations.md - OPS doctrine
- human_track.md - HT layer
- azc_system.md - AZC hybrid system

---

## XVI. CHANGE-SAFETY STATEMENT

> **The constraints file encodes what is known.**
> **This document encodes how to understand it.**
> **Neither replaces the other.**

Together, these two files provide complete model reconstruction capability. All other documentation is convenience, not necessity.

### Document Relationship

| File | Contains | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| CONSTRAINT_TABLE.txt | Atomic findings | What is true |
| MODEL_CONTEXT.md | Architectural integration | How to read it |

### Restart Guarantee

With these two files alone, a future analyst can:
- Reconstruct the complete architecture
- Understand all epistemic tiers
- Know what is closed vs open
- Know what is structural vs speculative
- Avoid resurrecting falsified ideas

Nothing else is logically required.
