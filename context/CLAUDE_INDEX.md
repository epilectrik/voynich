## Project Identity (Tier 0)

The Voynich Manuscript's Currier B text (61.9% of tokens, 83 folios) encodes a family of **closed-loop, kernel-centric control programs** designed to maintain a system within a narrow viability regime, governed by a single shared grammar.

This is not language. This is not cipher. This is a control system reference manual.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Instruction classes | 49 (9.8x compression from 479 token types) |
| Grammar coverage | 100% |
| Folios enumerated | 83 (75,248 instructions) |
| Translation-eligible zones | 0 |
| Forbidden transitions | 17 (in 5 hazard classes) |

## How to Think About Tokens (Structural Layer)

Within the internal structural analysis, Voynich tokens function differently than words in natural language. Understanding this prevents a common misinterpretation.

**Key principles:**

1. **Tokens are surface realizations, not functional operators.** At the level of grammar reconstruction, the functional behavior of a token is determined by its *instruction class*, not by the token itself. The 479 distinct token types collapse to 49 instruction classes (9.8x compression).

2. **Most tokens are interchangeable within their class.** Just as assembly language mnemonics (MOV, ADD, JMP) map to opcodes, Voynich tokens map to instruction classes. The specific token is often a surface variant; the class determines behavior.

3. **High hapax rates are expected, not anomalous.** Compositional morphology (PREFIX + MIDDLE + SUFFIX) generates unique surface forms naturally. A 35-39% hapax rate follows directly from productive combination, not from vocabulary size or "unknown" content.

4. **A token lacking special highlighting is NOT unknown.** Every token has a structural classification (instruction class, morphological decomposition, system legality). "Neutral" means "non-contrastive"—the token does not carry *additional* discriminative signal beyond its base class. It does not mean the token is unanalyzed.

**Analogy:** Consider a programming language where `foo`, `bar`, and `qux` are all valid variable names. They are structurally equivalent (all identifiers), interchangeable in most contexts, and individually unremarkable. Their *function* is determined by their syntactic role, not their spelling. Voynich tokens work similarly at the structural level.

---

## Why Visualization Tools Highlight Only Some Tokens

Visualization tools (like Script Explorer) highlight tokens based on **contrastive marker roles**—features that distinguish subsets of tokens from the general population:

- A-enriched vs B-enriched tokens
- Kernel-heavy vs kernel-light prefixes
- Line-position markers
- LINK operators

This highlighting reflects UI design choices optimized for showing *discriminative* features, not the boundaries of structural knowledge.

**What the highlighting does NOT mean:**
- Unhighlighted ≠ unknown
- Unhighlighted ≠ unclassified
- Unhighlighted ≠ outside the grammar

All tokens are structurally classified. The ~10-30% that receive highlighting carry *additional* contrastive information. The ~70-90% that appear neutral are fully classified but lack special discriminative roles.

## Structural Analysis vs Interpretive / Probabilistic Reasoning

This project maintains a clear boundary between two analytical layers:

**Structural Layer (Tier 0-2):** Internal grammar reconstruction based on distributional evidence, transition patterns, and morphological analysis. Statements in this layer describe what the text *is* structurally—instruction classes, operator roles, hazard topology, convergence behavior. These are established facts about the internal organization of the text.

**Interpretive Layer (Tier 3-4):** Reasoning about what the control system might *do* in the real world, what processes it might govern, or how to fit probabilistic models to observed distributions. This layer is explicitly allowed, operates conditionally on structural constraints, and remains quarantined from frozen facts.

**Critical clarification:** Nothing in the structural layer forbids or pre-judges Bayesian fitting, probabilistic interpretation, or domain-specific hypothesis testing. These are welcome in the interpretive layer, provided they:
- Accept structural constraints as given
- Do not contradict Tier 0 facts
- Are documented in SPECULATIVE/ with appropriate tier labels

Structural analysis establishes *what exists*. Interpretive reasoning explores *what it might mean*.

## Epistemic Tiers

| Tier | Label | Meaning | Action |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| 0 | FROZEN FACT | Proven by internal structural analysis | Do not reopen |
| 1 | FALSIFICATION | Hypothesis tested and rejected | Do not retry |
| 2 | STRUCTURAL INFERENCE | High-confidence bounded conclusion | Reference when needed |
| 3-4 | SPECULATIVE | Interpretive / idea-generation | Quarantine from facts |

---

## STOP CONDITIONS

Before reading further or doing new analysis:

- **Tier 0 facts are PROVEN** - do not attempt to reopen or "improve"
- **Tier 1 claims are FALSIFIED** - do not retry rejected approaches
- **New analysis must cite phase + constraint number** - no uncited claims
- **Speculation stays in SPECULATIVE/** - never promote without evidence
- **Prefix matching ≠ token matching** - common bug, see SYSTEM/METHODOLOGY.md
- **Check constraints BEFORE speculating** - search CLAIMS/ before reasoning about relationships (see SYSTEM/METHODOLOGY.md → "Constraint-First Reasoning")

**Questioning constraints is allowed** when you find gaps, contradictions, or new evidence — but state the conflict explicitly and propose investigation rather than silently overriding.

### Audit Scope Rule

> **Lack of documentation density is NOT evidence of missing structure.**
> Tier 3-4 unknowns are allowed, expected, and CLOSED internally.
> Only contradictions at Tier 0 or Tier 1 constitute errors.

When auditing this project, do not treat sparse documentation as a gap. Some areas (Human Track, folio structure) have fewer constraints because they are **properly bounded**, not incomplete.

## Default Resolution Policy

Unless explicitly instructed otherwise, follow this procedure:

1. Attempt to resolve the user's question using ONLY files in `context/`.
2. If the answer can be fully determined from context:
   - Answer directly.
   - Do NOT read phase or archive files.
3. If the context system is insufficient:
   - REPORT what specific information is missing.
   - STOP.
4. Do NOT escalate into phase reports, archives, or raw data unless the user
   explicitly requests investigation, verification, or audit.

---

## Escalation Rule

Reading any files outside `context/` (e.g., `phases/`, `archive/`, raw data)
is considered an escalation step.

Escalation must be justified by demonstrated context insufficiency and
requires explicit authorization from the user.

## What This Project Does NOT Allow

These approaches have been **structurally falsified** (Tier 1):

- **Language encoding** - 0.19% reference rate (Phase X.5)
- **Cipher encoding** - transforms decrease mutual information (Phase G)
- **Glyph-level semantics** - 0 identifier tokens found (Phase 19)
- **Illustration-dependent logic** - swap invariance p=1.0 (Phase ILL)
- **Step-by-step recipe format** - families are emergent (Phase FSS)
- **Material/ingredient encoding** - pure operational, no referents
- **Translation attempts** - 0 translation-eligible zones exist

See [CORE/falsifications.md](CORE/falsifications.md) for complete list with evidence.

---

## What the Manuscript DOES Encode

**Proven (Tier 0):**
- Executable grammar (49 classes, 100% coverage)
- Kernel control (3 operators: k, h, e)
- Hazard topology (17 forbidden transitions, 5 failure classes)
- Convergence to stable states (57.8% terminal STATE-C)
- LINK operator (38% of text = deliberate waiting)
- Folio = complete program, Line = formal control block

**Not encoded (operator provides externally):**
- Sensory completion judgment (when to stop)
- Material selection (what to process)
- Hazard recognition (physical signs of failure)

See [CORE/model_boundary.md](CORE/model_boundary.md) for complete boundary.

## Three Text Systems

The manuscript contains three distinct systems sharing a **global morphological type system** (not grammar):

> **Important distinction:** The "single shared grammar" in the frozen conclusion applies to **Currier B only**. Currier A uses a different formal system (non-sequential). What IS shared across all three systems is the morphological TYPE system (prefix/suffix structure, compositional rules).

| System | % Tokens | Folios | Function |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Currier B** | 61.9% | 83 | Sequential executable programs |
| **Currier A** | 30.5% | 114 | Non-sequential categorical registry |
| **AZC** | 7.7% | 30 | Hybrid diagram annotation (labeling) |

- A and B are **FOLIO-DISJOINT** (0 shared folios)
- A and B are **GRAMMAR-DISJOINT** (different formal systems)
- A and B are **VOCABULARY-INTEGRATED** (69.8% shared types)
- AZC bridges both with 60.5% shared vocabulary

See [ARCHITECTURE/cross_system.md](ARCHITECTURE/cross_system.md) for details.
