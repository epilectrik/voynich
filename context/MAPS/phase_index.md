## External Alignment Phases

| Phase | Description | Key Finding |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| PVC-1 | Puff-Voynich curriculum comparison | 83-unit structure shared (5/5 tests PASS) |
| PVC-2 | Brunschwig degree alignment | Regime = Degree (13/15 metrics match) |
| PVC-3 | A morphology affordance alignment | Affordance axes align (5/5 tests PASS) |
| **BTF** | **Brunschwig Template Fit** | **Grammar-level embedding (C493, C494)** |
| **BBV** | **Brunschwig Backprop Validation** | **EXPLANATORY SATURATION (5 fits, no new constraints)** |

**Summary:** Puff (1455) + Voynich = complementary curriculum halves. Brunschwig (1500) combined both for novices. A discriminates operational affordance profiles, not material identity. BBV confirms model saturated: property-based generators FAIL to reproduce structure.

## Entity Matching Corrected (2026-01-14)

| Phase | Description | Key Finding |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| EMC-1 | Entity matching with curriculum mapping | Degree 3 → LATE positions (mean 72.6) |
| EMC-2 | Positional alignment test | Significant correlation rho=0.350, p=0.0012 |
| EMC-3 | Skip alignment test | **+28.7% improvement** with gaps (31.3% → 60.0%) |

**Note:** Re-ran TIER4_EXTENDED tests with corrected degree-to-regime mapping based on curriculum position discovery. Skip alignment reveals partial transmission with systematic omissions.
