# What the Human Track Is (and Is Not)

**Purpose:** Prevent semantic projection onto HT. This document defines the structural boundaries of what HT evidence supports.

---

## The One-Sentence Summary

> **HT is a single, manuscript-wide orientation layer applied continuously across production sessions, modulated by system context and codicological units, carrying no semantic content.**

---

## What HT IS (Structurally Proven)

### 1. A Single Unified Notation System

- Same 19 prefixes appear across Currier A, B, and AZC (Jaccard >= 0.947)
- Not three parallel systems - ONE system with density variation
- Morphologically distinct from operational grammar (zero prefix overlap)

### 2. Codicologically Organized

- Quire-level clustering (eta-squared = 0.150)
- Respects physical production units
- Applied in quire-sized work sessions

### 3. System-Stratified

- Density varies: A (17.0%) > AZC (16.2%) > B (14.9%)
- Density shifts at system boundaries
- Vocabulary does NOT change - only frequency

### 4. Session-Continuous

- Adjacent folios share 1.69x more HT vocabulary
- Stronger adjacency than Currier A (1.31x)
- Applied with production session coherence

### 5. Non-Operational

- Removing all 40,000 HT tokens would not affect grammar coverage
- Does not predict execution outcomes
- Does not alter grammar flow
- Completely avoids hazard positions

### 6. Phase-Synchronized

- HT prefixes correlate with procedural phase
- EARLY: op-, pc-, do-
- LATE: ta-
- Tracks human-relevant phase without controlling execution

## What HT is NOT (Common Misinterpretations)

### NOT a Message or Label System

HT tokens do not carry semantic content. They are:
- Not names
- Not ingredients
- Not instructions
- Not translations
- Not commentary

**Why not:** 67.5% hapax rate, Zipf distribution, no referential patterns.

### NOT Scribal Errors

- 33% "error rate" is implausible
- Too structured (section-specific patterns)
- Too systematic (morphological regularities)
- Complete hazard avoidance (errors wouldn't avoid hazards)

### NOT a Separate Document

- Perfectly synchronized with B's grammar and hazards
- Why would a separate document correlate with execution phases?
- Integrated at production level

### NOT Random Mark-Making

- Strong section exclusivity (80.7%)
- Rare grapheme over-representation (7.81x)
- Deliberate skill practice patterns
- Systematic curriculum signatures

### NOT Material Annotation

- No referential tokens
- No counting behavior
- No sensory checkpoint patterns
- Avoids rather than clusters at hazards

## The Functional Interpretation (Tier 3)

The evidence supports a **dual-purpose attention mechanism**:

1. **Attention maintenance** during waiting phases
2. **Skill practice** in the written form

This explains:
- Why HT correlates with waiting-heavy programs (more time to write)
- Why HT avoids hazards (attention demanded elsewhere)
- Why HT shows rare grapheme engagement (practicing difficult forms)
- Why HT has session continuity (same scribe in one session)
- Why HT is morphologically distinct (avoid confusion with operational text)

---

## Why HT Looks Random to Semantic Readers

If you try to read HT as language:
- 67.5% of tokens appear exactly once (no meaningful repetition)
- No consistent token-meaning mapping
- No sentence structure
- Distribution matches generative practice, not communication

**HT was never meant to be read.** It was meant to be *written* - as orientation markers and skill practice during operational waiting.

## The Architectural Role

In the 4-layer model:

| Layer | System | Function | Organization |
|-------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Execution | Currier B | Adaptive control | Folio-local |
| Distinction | Currier A | Registry | Adjacency-clustered runs |
| Context | AZC | Scaffolding | Discrete rigid blocks |
| **Orientation** | **HT** | **Human attention** | **Quire-clustered, session-continuous** |

HT is the **glue that makes silence usable**.

The manuscript never explains itself because:
- AZC locks context
- B adapts continuously
- A externalizes complexity
- **HT keeps the human oriented**

---

## What Would Falsify This?

The HT interpretation would be challenged if:

1. HT tokens showed referential patterns (pointing to things)
2. HT predicted execution outcomes (causal role)
3. HT clustered AT hazards rather than avoiding them
4. HT showed consistent cross-section vocabulary (not section-exclusive)
5. HT showed translation-eligible structure (message patterns)

None of these have been observed.

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is HT meaningful? | Structurally yes, semantically no |
| Is HT random? | No - highly organized, just not communicative |
| Is HT operational? | No - removal doesn't affect grammar |
| Is HT noise? | No - too structured, too systematic |
| What is HT for? | Human orientation during production |

**Status:** CLOSED. HT is architecturally complete.
