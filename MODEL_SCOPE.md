# Model Scope Declaration

This document defines the epistemic boundaries of the Voynich Manuscript structural analysis.

---

## What This Repository DOES

1. **Structural exhaustion** of Voynich Manuscript Currier B text
2. **Grammar extraction** — 49 instruction classes, 100% coverage (corpus-aggregate)
3. **Hazard topology** — 17 forbidden transitions, 5 failure classes
4. **Kernel identification** — k, h, e control operators
5. **A/B/AZC classification** — Three-mode structural disjunction proof
6. **Falsification** — Language, cipher, and translation hypotheses rejected

---

## What This Repository Does NOT Do

1. **Semantic recovery** — No token meanings are assigned
2. **Product identification** — Process classes survive; specific products are Tier 3+
3. **Historical attribution** — No author, date, or location claims
4. **Illustration interpretation** — Proven epiphenomenal (Phase ILL)
5. **Material identification** — Abstract classes only (CLASS_A through CLASS_E)
6. **Tier promotions** — Tier 3/4 findings require Bayesian framework (separate repo)

## Intentional "Gaps"

These are **scope boundaries**, not deficiencies to remediate:

| Apparent Gap | Why Intentional |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Per-folio coverage percentages | Aggregate + robustness tests (noise, ablation, cross-validation) are sufficient |
| Section-by-section grammar validation | Families proven emergent; sections are organizational, not grammatical |
| Instruction class distribution by section | Descriptive statistic, not structural discovery |
| Tier 3 → Tier 2 promotions | Require external Bayesian framework; outside this repo's epistemic contract |
| Section S/T deep analysis | Minimal variation detected; not warranted by structural signal |
| Structural primitives section validation | Category error; `daiin`/`ol` are infrastructure, not distributional entities |

---

## Epistemic Contract

| Tier | Allowed Evidence | Constraint Type |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| 0 (FROZEN FACT) | Internal structural analysis only | Definitional |
| 1 (FALSIFICATION) | Internal structural analysis only | Rejection |
| 2 (STRUCTURAL INFERENCE) | Bounded inference from internal structure | Derived |
| 3 (SPECULATIVE ALIGNMENT) | External domain alignment | Non-binding |
| 4 (EXPLORATORY) | Idea generation | Non-binding |

**Rules:**
- No claim may be promoted from Tier 3+ to Tier 2 without **new internal structural evidence**
- No external domain knowledge may inform Tier 0-2 claims
- Falsifications (Tier 1) are permanent unless structural error is demonstrated

## Audit Response: Rejected Suggestions

The 2026-01-07 hygiene audit identified several suggestions that were **explicitly rejected** as scope creep:

1. **Section-by-section grammar validation** — Not required; robustness tests substitute
2. **Per-folio coverage audit** — Low ROI; aggregate metrics sufficient
3. **Tier 3 → Tier 2 promotions** — Require Bayesian framework (future repo)
4. **Predictive hazard tests from external texts** — Violates internal-only constraint
5. **Structural primitives section validation** — Category error; infrastructure role established

These rejections are **final** for this repository.
