============================================================

so the vanity manuscript this crazy mysterious manuscript written in this crazy
mysterious language code glyph sex we don't even know what to call it because
we don't know whether it's a code or a transcription or a translation or
gibberish we just don't know this is this is where people like professor bower
come in it's it's her job to figure that out uh my job is to think about the
codecological structure of the manuscript what we can learn from that uh and
the the paleography which is of course why we're here because we are going to
learn some voynich poliography and as i said last week i've never taught
voynich poliography before so this is the first time ever in all of history
that this particular topic has been taught so that's exciting news so here we
go so you've all read presumably rey's um the pieces that i assigned to you
from this fabulous book with its fabulous author right here i highly recommend
this book the voynich manuscript edited by ray clemens it's very inexpensive
and it's really really terrific there's a lot of a lot of really interesting
stuff in here and it comes with a uh with effects similar photo a photo effects
simile and as you've seen the whole manuscript has been imaged very high
resolution open access images available online not good enough for some boiler
challenges who think that they need to be higher resolution these images are
high enough resolution for anything anybody wants to do so let's run through
the history of the manuscript really quickly because everything about this
manuscript any anything you can glean is going to be important and anyone who
has a theory to uh put out there about the voyage manuscript is extremely
important that all of the things that we know about it already are factored
into that uh into that theory i've kind of become a professional voyage
debunker over the years and part of my response is always have you done the
reading have you checked the facts make sure that whatever you're doing is
consistent with what we actually know about this manuscript because there are a
lot of people out there with a lot of ideas about it and many of them are not
founded on anything except their own uh inspiration is that their questions but
they still get published on the topic yes anyone will publish anything these
days two years ago the titans book review in london uh published a whole
article about how the voynich was just abbreviations that one could use
capellis to decode and they told me this was coming out and i said do you want
to run it by me just to see because i've seen a few no no no we want everyone
it's absolutely convincing we wanted all everyone to see it all at the same
time and i got it but i was hysterical i thought it was the funniest thing i've
ever seen it was embarrassing it was a business so so let's talk about the
let's talk about the facts so here's what we what we know what we think we know
the first time the manuscript enters the historic record is when it is
purchased by emperor rudolph ii of germany the holy roman emperor uh in the
sometime in the late 16th century we don't know exactly when but the reason we
know this is because of this letter this is the facsimile of the letter the
real letter is in the in the stack somewhere but we have this letter that was
written uh in 1665 that details the early history of the manuscript and it came
to the bible key with the manuscript itself and it provides a lot of
information we have to take it on faith that what is reported here is is true
because there there isn't any secondary evidence yet supporting uh some of the
earliest history of the manuscript so edward rudolph ii buys the manuscript he
passes it on after his death uh well he thinks it's uh written by john d um
that is is it isn't it's maybe it was owned by him once upon a time probably
not but there's no evidence there's no evidence people really really want john
d to be associated with this manuscript but the evidence is very very
circumstantial after the emperor dies he leaves the manuscript to jacob
tinapius whose name in czech i cannot pronounce temponach and if we go to the
actual manuscript here for a moment we go back to the very first page there is
in fact uh an erased inscription right here let me zoom in on that you can see
this part at the bottom that's been that has sort of a stain and that is
damaged and under ultraviolet light you can actually uh read this so there's
the first page here we're going to zoom in at the bottom and look at the
ultraviolet image kind of hard to see in this light but you can in fact make
out this signature of uh tinafias who was an alchemist in prague so so far
we've got two owners in prague we're in prague where rudolph's court was and
now tanakis who inherits the manuscript he passes it on to his friend george
varesh in the middle of the 17th century or when he dies so he dies in 1622 so
at that point it's handed over to you then it makes its way to johannes marcus
markey and he was the one who wrote this letter that he sent with the
manuscript when he gave it as a gift to athanasius kierke who's a very
well-known jesuit scholar and so this is a letter to kierke from marky and in
this letter he explains what he knows of the history of the manuscript and then
talks about um efforts to decipher it kierker had just published a a dictionary
of hieroglyphics so marky was convinced that nobody but athanasius kierker
could possibly figure out what this manuscript says so at that point in 1665
the manuscript is set to run and it stays there for a really long time in the
hand of hands of the jesuits we think probably probably so at the collegue
romano uh the librarian petrus dex his um book plate is in one of these boxes
associates it uh continuing the association with the jesuits in rome and then
uh the jesuit college at villa mandragone outside of rome which is where
wilfred voynich finds it and purchases it the story what really happened we
don't know but the story goes that he was there they needed some money they
said to him buy whatever you want just go rummage and he found this manuscript
and he just kind of added it to his pile and so he's got this big pile of
manuscripts and he says hey you know i'll give you this much for this for this
group and they're like sure fine so he takes these manuscripts they didn't
really know what he had bought or what he had left or so he has this manuscript
now during his lifetime he refused to say where he had acquired it um possibly
because he wasn't maybe he didn't feel that he didn't want them to know that he
had ended up with it or to enhance the mystery of it so all of these rumors
start flying around voynich that maybe he had written it himself or who knows
where it had come from so about 1919 voynich comes to the united states and
sets up shop in manhattan right across the street from the new york public
library and starts trying to market this manuscript and the only way he knows
the only way anybody's going to buy this book is if he can get some scholarly
credibility behind it somebody who can read it who can give it a really
fantastic origin story and then he's going to sell it for a hundred thousand
dollars make just buckets and buckets of money nobody wants to buy this
manuscript because nobody knows what it is uh in the meantime uh just after uh
he moves to new york he is bragging to someone at a dinner party in chicago
about this manuscript he owns that no one can read and the person sitting
across from him does his patriotic duty and reports it to the fbi and says
there's this immigrant with this funny accent is probably jewish and he has
this manuscript that's a code so i think you should investigate him and they do
the fbi investigates voyage for years uh accusing him of having a secret code
book that he's um using to spy on the united states government eventually he
convinces them that it is in fact an ancient manuscript and he does this with
the help of several professors one from the university of chicago and one from
the university of pennsylvania this gentleman uh professor newbold so william
newbold is the first person to put out a voynich theory and then be publicly
humiliated about it it's a long a long line of people who have had that
experience his humiliation happened after he was dead so it didn't happen they
waited to publish the rebuttal of his theory until he had died um and so his
theory is that the manuscript is written in uh basically micrography that each
glyph or letter form is uh made up of tiny little letters that when you put
them together there they create uh an encoded text that he then decodes it's
not true it's just it's just not uh and his theory uh results in the um he has
this he draws this conclusion that the whole thing was written by roger bacon
roger bacon 13th century roger bacon uh so this idea that bacon uh had a
telescope so this is supposed to be a drawing of the uh one of the nebulas the
andromeda nebula i think and this the world goes crazy when this is announced
in 1919 uh and then his book is published posthumously and there are all these
articles in the newspaper it sounds familiar right this is what happens today
somebody puts a theory out there to the world the press goes berserk and then
later on in a respectable journal speculum the journal of the medieval academy
of america the organization that i am now the executive director of which is a
nice synergy uh in speculum after his death his theory is just savage just
completely ripped to shreds in 50 pages probably the longest book review that's
ever been published in speculum so moving along newbold's theory has been
completely trashed no one will buy this stupid manuscript voynich dies in 1931
and the manuscript becomes part of his estate where it is recorded in the 1938
dorichi census of medieval and renaissance manuscripts in the united states and
canada is recorded as just the cipher manuscript so now his wife has it ethel
so ethel has the manuscript now she can't sell it either and the office manager
business manager and neil continues to try and network and try and work the
worker contacts to see if she can sell this manuscript they're going broke with
voynich after voynich died they don't have money to pay off their debts they
can't sell anything the depression is hit the great collectors are not buying
for the time being because they can't they've all you know been been demolished
by the depression so they're stuck with it they put it in a safe and they just
they just leave it even as they're selling off all of their stock shutting down
the business but they still have the voyage manuscript sitting in a safe and
they're paying to insure it but they and they cannot they cannot get rid of the
damn thing then ethel dies in 1961 the manuscript is inherited by andell their
long-time business manager so now anil's trying to sell the manuscript by
herself she can't do it she makes an arrangement with a book dealer hans krauss
in new york she sells the manuscript to him for twenty four thousand five
hundred dollars uh in exchange for a commitment that when he sells it she'll
get half of the proceeds above her original sales price so now hans cross has
got the manuscript it's 1962. and for seven years he's trying to sell this
manuscript no one will buy it because nobody knows what it is is it a forgery
is it a fake is it was it something voyage did nobody knows what it is what it
means how important or unimportant it might be and so krause is stuck with it
and yet at the same time there are all these people who want to see it everyone
is showing up people make demands they want to look at it they want to order
pictures and so in the end he decides he's going to give it to an institution
so that it can be freely studied and that institution as spoiler alert as you
can probably guess was the binding keyword book in manuscript library with whom
he had a really long and uh fruitful business relationship yale has hundreds of
manuscripts that they bought from krauss over the years so it has been here
here it is and it has been here since uh 1969 just sitting in the dark in its
cozy little custom box waiting for someone to figure out what the heck it is um
and now that there are uh high resolution images online the whole world can get
after it um and i'll tell you really quickly my own relationship with this
manuscript started in 1988 when i was hired as the assistant to the curator of
pre-1600 rare books and manuscripts robert babcock uh here in the by mcgee uh
when i started grad school and bob for whom this was really across to bear this
manuscript he wanted nothing to do with the correspondence and so part of my
responsibilities involved handling voyage-related correspondence so whenever
some theory showed up or someone needed images or they needed something checked
it was it was my job to go and answer uh that and so i have correspondence
going with some interesting people for a while there so i've been really
interested in this manuscript for a really long time but it's only in the in
recent years as i as it's become more well known online and and more and more
solutions are getting posted and tweeted and blogged about and just out there
on social media that um i've been doing i started doing more and more reading
about it um this book came out i read you know that i've read uh several times
and i saw in several places people saying things like we just don't really know
how many scribes there are we really need a paleographer to look at this
problem and at one point i thought holy crap i'm a paleontologist this is the
job i was born to do and so that's how i started thinking about the scripted
scribes of the voyage and actually doing thinking of it as a as a legitimate
object worthy of actual study instead of just something that you roll your eyes
about uh and of course that still happens um but it is an actual real medieval
object and worthy of study now before i give the big reveal and if you if you
did the reading you already know the answer to this question there's a little
blank space at the top of my slide there for the date of origin of the
manuscript of the parchment for the manuscript and if you did the reading you
know this already but i would ask you heliographers that you are if i just
showed you this image and i said well what do you think your paleographers what
do you think is it what is it what does it remind you of what what what era
does it feel like is it is it late antique is it pre-caroline is it caroline is
it romanesque is it gothic is it humanistic pick one don't be scared any
thoughts come on don't be frightened anyone have any ideas here let's look at
it this way here are some voynich ease letters on the left with some analogous
letters from a contemporary manuscript can you zoom in can you make that bigger
i don't know if it's possible to make that larger for everyone yeah that's much
better does that help any ideas anyone [Music] humanist who said that i can't
see he said yes exactly it is very very reminiscent of italian humanist
manuscripts script that doesn't mean it's italian people like to think that
that means it's italian but it does not mean that at all and yes it has a lot
of similarities to some of the some of the characters so the characters that
i've put up the voyniches characters some letters on the left some numbers on
the right are very similar to um what you might encounter in an early 15th
century italian manuscripts this one is uh from the huntington and here i put
them side by side now the the trap that people fall into is they think oh well
that looks like a humanistic letter that looks like it's a town that's really
similar to what you find in italy therefore the manuscript must be from italy
and that's the that's the kind of leaps of logic that we really have to be
careful about because we don't know where this manuscript was written those
similarities could just be coincidences could be written by someone you know in
timbuktu for all we know there's we just don't know all we know is that it
enters the historic record in prague that's really all we know um there is
other evidence in the manuscript though about its earlier history and we'll
look at that in a minute however they did in 2011 something like that the
carbon dating yeah i can find it oh it's in the black yeah this is the book so
target dating of the parchment concluded within a 98 probability or some
something very solid 2009 that the parchment was sourced the animal was killed
and stopped growing uh between 1404 and 1438. that's a really that's a really
great time period that's a pretty short window uh there so and people like to
say well maybe the parchment sat around for 500 years maybe but that's pretty
unlikely maybe voynich cleaned the parchment he found old parchment cleaned it
all off and forged this new manuscript possible really unlikely you know you
got to think about the bell curve right i mean in the round the possibility yes
it could have been dropped off by aliens last week sure but voyage would have
had to have known what the inks yes exactly he he was writing in the time
before the forensic analysis of inks so right and and testing testing on the
inks has also shown that they are consistent with medieval ink uh that they are
not um they don't have any modern uh and the same with the pigments that the
inks and the pigments are all consistent with medieval techniques and medieval
uh ingredients so i think we all feel pretty good saying yes this manuscript
dates from the early 15th century where i don't know almost certainly not on
this side of the atlantic some have argued that it's meso-american pretty
unlikely uh we now know roger bacon is definitely out because he was long dead
i people wanted to make a case for leonardo da vinci nope he wasn't even born
yet so then you get people running around going well if it's from the early
15th century who are the people we know about who might have been able to who
might have made this manuscript well that's very nice but of all the people who
were alive at that time how many of them have actually made it into the
historic record pretty small few pretty small number so now we're left with so
that's all we know that's all we know there's a lot still we don't know for
example what the damn thing says um and so now i want to give you a very quick
tour of the contents and then to show you that sort of thinking about the the
genre of this book so it begins with 55 leaves and i'm going to leave this just
sitting here open but i don't want to handle it any more than absolutely
necessary so i'm going to flip through this book because this one we can do
whatever we want to okay so we start with pages and pages and pages of
botanical illustrations i've heard this one referred to as as representing
cannabis uh so we go and each of these appears to be by when you compare it to
other botanicals other herbals this is how they tend to be written where you
have the a very detailed illustration so for each one of these plants if it's
got some kind of flower it's got a stem and leaves and it has a root system and
then you have some kind of text that presumably describes it how to take care
of it and what its um what its features are uh medicinally or what it's used
for and this goes on and on and on for 50 something 55 leaves then and and
they're really not particularly identifiable as real plants people spend a lot
of time trying to identify these but they're some of them are are pretty
clearly not real plants uh but maybe they're fantastic um badly drawn
illustrations of real plants i i couldn't possibly tell you but there are
people who have devoted an awful lot of time to identifying what all of these
different plans are so when we get through that section we have um sort of some
miscellaneous stuff uh that we'll talk about more pretty soon then you have the
first of a series of fold-outs now the actual fold-outs in the manuscript are
much too fragile to open so for the fold-outs we we have to look at the at the
facsimile but these are um they're stars sun moon there's some kind of
astronomical or astrological and you can imagine how excited people get about
these stars because each one of them seems to have a label next to it uh and if
of course if we could read what these labels said we would know something very
useful about the manuscript but we cannot read them as of yet then you have uh
these zodiacal diagrams over here uh some of them are missing but there should
be one per month they're very clearly identifiable as signs of the zodiac so
this one for example uh you've got the two fish so here's pisces here's aries
and on and on and this is where we get some of the evidence about the
mysterious 150 years between when the manuscript was produced and when it
arrives in prague to emperor rudolph's court because in the middle of these
diagrams are these later annotations can you see that right there i'll hold it
up this way right there so uh that one says april for example but they're not
they're not obviously recognizable as any particular romance language but they
are definitely some kind of romance language where the the names of the months
have actually been recorded uh in a slightly later hand than the manuscript i
don't think it's too much later what do you think every reason yeah yeah i i
think we're all in agreement there that that's those were probably added in the
some time in the 15th century but are they evidence about the early ownership
or the early journeys of the manuscript probably then we get to my favorite
part of the manuscript i love this part the bowel neological section so
baumiology there we go bioneology is the the medieval science of medicinal
bathing so it's called the bowel neology section we don't know if that's really
what it's about but it has all these pictures of of ladies bathing and some
kind of waterworks flowing so and then over here you have what seemed to be and
i always seem to be because we just don't know but they should look like um by
biological diagrams and down here too um that looks like a female reproductive
system is it that i don't know i wouldn't say it is that but that's what it
looks like uh all right so then you've got the bountyology section and that
goes on for a while then we have uh what is this pretty fabulous fold out and
we cannot definitely not open it in the real one because it is extremely
fragile but you you you start with these three pages and then you open it and
you get this really crazy uh page in nine segments it tends to be referred to
as the rosettes page and there these are identified by directional um quadrants
so this would be north east this is northwest south and so on just as a way of
identifying where you are on the page and they have writing and they have
little there are little structural images there's this looks like a little
castle here what this is i have no idea but it's uh another part of the
manuscript that that people who study it really get obsessed with is it a map
is it some kind of diagram is it some kind of um a chart showing uh movements
of people across space and time i can't i can't even i just who knows and so
there's nothing like it there's absolutely nothing um nothing analogous to uh
to that and then you have kind of some miscellaneous bits back here that seem
to be out of order maybe that are kind of mixed up these pages that that are
referred to as pharmacological because they've got all of these what look like
ingredients and then some kind of vessel and maybe some instructions are they
recipes maybe maybe not but that's sort of what they what they look like so
they tend to be referred to as recipes or uh the pharmacological section some
more botany a few more herbal pages mixed in and then we go back to the
pharmaceuticals and then at the very end you have a whole choir here of um
paragraphs each of which is marked by a by a star there are not 365 of them
we'd like there to be 365 but there are not uh and of course what is this
there's absolutely no context for this there isn't even any illustrative
context to help you get a handle on what this might be the other the other
sections of the manuscript at least you can kind of positively guess based on
the illustration and then the manuscript ends there and then um can i flip this
to the to the back all right so let's look at the last the last page of the
actual manuscript so you can see what we're talking about here so way up here
at the top can you zoom in at the top there there are a few lines of text that
are kind of a mixture of german and um voyniches and maybe something else
they're they're not the same as the script and the text that you find elsewhere
in the manuscript and this these just these few lines very difficult to read
faded abraded um a lot of a lot of people have thought are the key to the whole
thing maybe maybe not that's the that's the crux of this whole manuscript it's
always maybe maybe not um so that's the the object itself so now let's let's
talk i'm going to move into talking about the methodologies that uh that
voidtologists use to attack this manuscript the first thing you have to do when
you're i'm just going to open it on to some place where the law is comfortably
there we go um one of the things that you have to do when you're looking and
you want to do some kind of a linguistic analysis say you can't type this into
a word processor or some kind of computing because a computer can't parse these
glyphs it can't make any sense out of them so a long time ago 40 40 something
years ago voynichologists started creating transcription alphabets that allow
you to type in voyages using ascii characters so here's an example of one of
those this is called the european voynich alphabet or actually now it's known
as the extensible voynich alphabet and it's the one that most people use so if
you are going to substitute uh one of the characters with one of these ascii
characters the main thing you always have to remember is it doesn't mean that
that is what that character means this is totally um random not completely
random because some of them sort of look like what they're transcribed as but
there there's no semantic relationship between these substitutions and the
voynich glyphs they just allow you to type up the uh to transcribe the
manuscript in a way that then a computer can go in and start analyzing
different combinations and different uh frequencies of letter forms uh which
then linguists like dr bowen can then compare to known languages and see if
there are any patterns that emerge now there are other um transcription
alphabets here's one called v101 that identifies many more of glyphs many more
symbols in the manuscript so then you have to ask yourself well how many how
many letters are there in voyniches nobody nobody can nobody can can come to
agreement on that question everyone has their own ideas about what constitutes
a separate two different letters two letters that look really similar but are
different slightly different in the way the stroke turns to the right as
opposed to going straight up are those the same just written slightly different
or are they actually two different letters it may sound like kind of an obscure
and unimportant detail but it's really really important for linguists to make
these decisions and they have to base their work on this on at the very
beginning on understanding how many letters there are in buoyancy i have my own
ideas based on my paleographical analyses because i come at this as a
paleographer so this is my my collection of buoyancy symbols in order of
frequency the one where people really disagree the most is this one that looks
like a four and a zero i'm going to refer to it as q o because in the
transcription alphabet that the letter that looks like a four is is called q um
so this is transcribed as q o i would make the case that because every time
this character occurs which is a lot all these yellow highlights are places on
those pages where you get that it is always almost always not always always go
back but almost always everywhere in the manuscript whichever scribe those two
characters are legated so they're always connected the number of times that you
see a queue without an o just both by itself are so rare as to be almost
statistically insignificant and so i would make the case that that's actually a
separate letter that it's not a cue followed by an o but its own separate glyph
and this becomes significant when you start looking at letter frequency so for
example here are these are all of the glyphs that have a occurrence of more
than two percent in the voynich manuscript and you can see in this calculation
this is assuming that q and o are two separate letters so when you look at this
if you calculate it that way o is the most common letter not remember it's not
an actual o it's a i'm just talking european voyage outfit here i'm speaking
eva so the o is the most common and you can see the q down there circled has a
percentage rate of almost three percent whereas the o is almost 12 if we redo
the calculation we and assume that qo is a single character so we have to
subtract from the number of o's the number of q o's so it's not double counted
look at what happens to the o suddenly the o is in third and its frequency rate
drops to less than nine percent and the q o is basically exactly the same
because there are so few instances of q by itself for me and my work this this
feels significant to me for linguists it's even more significant as claire
would tell you because the frequencies really matter when you're trying to
compare with frequencies in in other languages claire do you want to jump in do
you have anything to add to that um sure yeah uh not not a lot to add to it but
i i agree absolutely and um so i guess one of the things that um i would add is
that um when we're decoding um letters or trying to work out what let like how
letters are formed into words and things like that often we make use of our
knowledge of the language to to do that so for instance if we have a a latin
manuscript and we're reading what's on the page we're usually not reading the
individual letters we're um getting a sense of the uh of the word and say okay
so that that word must be um in keep it therefore even though i can't even read
i can't really read this p i know it must be a p because i know what this word
is um and so for for buena cheese we don't know what the words are um we don't
know what all the letters are um and so that makes it very difficult to um
build hypotheses about what the um about the language underlying it and what
the what the relationship is between the words and the um the words the letters
and the sounds that the letters might represent even if they even do represent
um uh individual uh individual sounds right idea right we don't even know what
genre the the separate letters represent right yeah so for instance if it's a
uh if it's a kind of substitution cipher where we write um uh say the um the c
character the most frequent character in uh in the uh uh the graph that's
that's on the the screen right now if that say that's an e and then say the
next one is an a and then the next one is an i or something like that we could
kind of read it like that but of course we get gibberish from uh from that um
and any sort of decoding like that has uh produced a lot of the examples of um
decoding and decipherment uh tend to be based on these these sort of pretty
straightforward substitution ciphers um and they're all they all produce
gibberish because they don't produce um reasonable language that uh that
underlies the um the system therefore we're probably not dealing with that sort
of system uh but what other sort of system we're dealing with is uh yeah very
much very much up in the air and that's why there are so there are so many
linguists working on this on this manuscript to try to attack it from all sorts
of different uh from all sorts of different angles and no one has really has
really found the answer yet we still don't even know for sure whether it
represents an actual human language or whether it doesn't you know there are
people who argue it does and people who argue it doesn't and they've all got
strong you know mathematical and linguistic arguments uh and we just actually i
would say a lot of the a lot of these um theories are not from not not so much
from uh from linguists but they're from people with hunches um they have a uh
uh my brilliant idea is that you know i looked at this manuscript and i thought
oh i bet it's this and then i look at all the um all the ideas that that make
uh that make me think all the evidence in favor of it being uh being this i i
think it's estonian and so i'm going to write all my energy into that you
always have to go back to first principles with any theory right you have to go
back to the very beginning and see what they're basing what are the assumptions
that they're starting with and if those assumptions can't be um can't be be
argued in a way that that is valid and convincing then the whole thing just
falls apart right and the assumptions are usually based on hunches and their
own brilliance and that often falls apart as we have seen um sometimes even
private sometimes in the pages of the conscious literary supplement my dog
spoke to me or something uh all right so let's move on now uh and let's talk
about um the so the glyph set right so we've already identified all of these
that have kind of analogs that look familiar that are designed to lead you
astray because they look so damn familiar but then you've also got these um
that are called gallows characters that are uh can be classified according to
how many loops and how many legs they have so um they're they're very very
common they're found everywhere in this manuscript and they're they're
unprecedented they're just totally unusual then you've also got what are called
bench gallows where that bench character is stretched out interfixed with the
gallows to create this new character and those also can be classified by the
number of loops and the number of legs so there already you've got a series of
characters that need to be added to our glove set then um on this sort of just
shows uh where you can see all of these characters in there in their natural
environment and that's actually page 50 it's folio 56 and 57 let's see here we
go so these two just by a nice coincidence on these two facing pages 57b and 58
you can actually see just about every character um that's used multi you know
multiple times in the manuscript and where um tobias is zooming in right now is
actually a really interesting page that has a lot of characters that appear
only once uh so i've circled them here um that are just totally mysterious with
no absolutely no idea and they don't appear anywhere else in the manuscript now
there are uh pages that are missing and we'll talk about the code ecology uh in
just a minute uh and then you also have these which are some of my favorite my
favorite voyage characters that are they look sort of like their ligatures of
dutches and bench gallows um but they also tend to appear only in the top
margin which or between paragraphs which suggest that they're decorative not
that they don't have a special semantic purpose um but that's also still uh to
be determined but i'm i'm really fascinated by them because they they look like
an attempt to combine these different gallows uh in some way and if we just
knew what the gallows meant we would be able to parse what's happening uh in
these kind of combos in these located combination um gallows and bench and
bench gallows characters all right so now let's talk about paleography because
that's why we're here uh let me keep an eye on the time um if everyone can can
stand it i think we won't take a break because we just have so much to do if
you need to run off and take a break please do that i'm gonna i'm gonna forge
ahead because we just have so much we want to talk about um so let's talk
paleography so what we're looking at here is a folio 31v and folio 32 so i'm
going to turn to those leaves in the actual manuscript here we go 31 verso and
32 recto and i will add here you can zoom in to the folio number the
exfoliation was added later this is significantly later maybe 17th century
maybe that it seems early to me but i don't go past 16 okay 16 17th century
after the manuscript was rebound and um since that foliation was added about a
dozen liens have gone missing and we know that because the foliation skips and
so that's how we know how many leaves are missing we don't know how many leaves
were missing before the foliation was added so we had no idea how many these
were actually originally in the manuscript but if we zoom in on these two would
i just do that there we go uh just by looking can you just sort of zoom in to
the middle like just zoom in as tight as you can yeah there we go so does
anybody anybody want to make some observations about these two hands is this
one hand is it two hands how are they the same how are they different anybody
want to jump in do you have any observations to make um they look quite like
they look fairly different in terms of just even the size and sort of the um
this would be kind the ductus would be related to the cramped sense of the one
handwriting yes exactly so this one over here on the left is is much more tight
cramped uh slanted whereas the one on the right is the the lines are more
broadly spaced this one i hate to use that word but it's more legible than than
the one on the right and so this um long back in the back in the 70s these two
hands were distinguished by a void of geologist named prescott courier so he
was the first person to to identify these two hands known as describe what it's
right here he also observed that there are linguistic patterns that are unique
to scribe one and that are unique described too so even though they're both
writing in voyages they have different um different some some different
linguistic quirks i won't say linguistic that's the wrong word orthographic who
knows what they need but they use voyages slightly differently and those
differences also are really important and i is something that's being um
investigated much more now by linguists and computer scientists and um so and
and those differences are they they're called language a and language b
language a is scribe one language b scribe two i don't claire can also pitch in
here but i i don't think they're different enough to be called different
languages i that just feels weird to me not a linguist but i wouldn't use that
term i tend to say dialects just because they're different but they're not
super different i don't know claire what do you what do you do yeah um i i use
language in uh scare quotes yeah for exactly the same reasons that um that you
mentioned so we don't know whether um it's the same language um underlying both
systems but a different uh incitement system or whether it's a um uh whether
there's uh yeah different variations in like uh more like regional dialects or
more like two closely related languages or um you know if one is latin and one
is french depending on the incitement system you might get similar sort of
things um but they do come out as different in um tests for things like word
frequency um and there are some patterns which are extremely common in uh in
one which are not very common in the other um but overall they're pretty
similar so the uh the characters that are um the most um the most frequent in
each um in each language are pretty similar they differ a little but then we
have uh we have much more of like uh we have more samples of language b than of
language a um because because language a is only scribe one right yeah yeah so
so so you talk about hand a hand one describe one squad two and language in
quotes language one like language a and language b so those are those are two
different um uh those are just two different things right the writing system
versus what is being written those are two different um two different things
but they are there is a very close association between language and scribe in
the manuscript and that that that feels significant we just don't know what it
what it actually means so we've known for a long time describe what i'm
subscribed to prescott courier went through the rest of the manuscript and made
a stab at at making other scribal distinctions but his his work wasn't really
thorough it wasn't really done and it wasn't all that convincing once you got
past describe what it's right too and so this is why i decided to to get in to
start doing polygraphical work on this manuscript because as i said i am in
fact a paleographer and a voyage and uh someone who's interested in the voynich
so it's a nice intersection of interests of mine and skill sets so now let's
talk about paleography so we've talked about this a lot paleography means a lot
of different skill sets right it's not it's about it's about a lot of things so
it's about attribution so comparing your manuscript with manuscripts of a known
date and place to see if you can decide is it french is it italian is it early
15th is it late 15th and that's the kind of work that we've that we've done
right when we were looking at uncharts well this is italian unchilled this is
northumbria nonchalant how do we tell the difference this is northern gothic
this is southern rotunda how do we tell the difference uh and so that's uh
attribution with the voynich there are no other samples to compare to so
attribution uh is out the door we can't do it what else have we got literacy
well obviously literacy is no good right we're trying to learn how to read
roman cursive uh you all were champions at that we're learning how to read but
hard right we're learning how to read these scripts that are not familiar to us
we can't read boy the cheese so we can't we can't do that either so attribution
is out literacy is out what have we got left well description let's dig into
the individual hands let's look at the graphic properties let's talk about
ductus let's talk about how each individual letter form is formed and talk
about how we can determine when a a page was written by one scribe as opposed
to having been written by another scribe and we did that as well right remember
when you were looking at the the caroline manuscript 571 i think it was where
we looked at all the different hands that occurred and tried to think about how
we can distinguish between them um by looking at the abbreviations or
particular letter forms and so we're going to take that skill set and apply it
to the voynich manuscript so that's what we did that's what i did and as you
know you've read my you've read the article hopefully uh that i assigned you
where i talked about this application that i've used called um digipal or now
it's known as archetype i custom designed my own database on my computer at
home called it voynich pal and it allows you to go through select and annotate
individual features apply your own custom data metadata to them then you can
pull those annotations out and you can sort them and you can throw them in a
lot in a light box where you can start moving them around like you have as if
you had paper on on your desk and you're shuffling them and sorting them uh
into categories and so that's how i started this process i looked at every
different glyph every different form letter letter form and zeroed in on forms
that by comparing square one and spread two which we already knew were
different which were the letter forms that seemed to be really different from
scribe one described two but consistent within that hand so the way that in
austria i might look at a ct ligature and use that to determine uh a han
identify hand or an ampersand or some other abbreviation or a question mark it
or the titus you know looking at these different um different features that are
are generally the same but have individual ticks that you can zero in on for
identifying one hand or another so here for example there and there i am
sorting and moving things around on the page and dividing them into groups and
uh so here for example are four versions of the letter form one loop two legs
uh the gallows that in eva is known as k so here's a k so if i were to put
these in front of you my paleography proteges how would you what are the the
features of these forms that look different to you from one to the other what
are the kinds of individual what makes them individual um in terms of the way
that they're written what are some of the features that that that jump out at
you is different from one to the other they have different feet yes exactly yes
they use the the very last tick at the bottom of the of the right hand ascender
the little foot there is different from one to the other anyone else the bottom
curve on the loop is a little bit different in angle with each one of them yeah
that's exactly right so if you're looking at that loop the bottom right sort of
where it intersects the ascender right is that what you're talking about
there's a there's a different angle there uh that's right yes so we've got a
loop we've got feet to look at what other features there's one other feature
that that struck me is interesting uh the crossbar is angled differently yup
exactly and the reason it's angled differently is because of how the scribe is
moving their path so if so for example on the far left there's a it's a sharp
right angle from the ascender to the uh the crossbar and that's because the
scribe has lifted their pen gone down and then made the crossbar whereas on the
on the third one it's curved and that's because the scribe didn't lift the pen
they go up and then down and across to make the curve so by looking at the the
way the pen moves the way that the scribe is forming the letters you could
start to make these distinctions so there we have the feet the angle of the
ascender what's happening uh whether it's made with one stroke or two so
whether the pen has been lifted before that crossbar happens and then finally
the the what's happening uh that that tells you something about whether that
crossbar is going to be bowed or if it's going to be horizontal so if it's
horizontal that implies that the pen has been lifted whereas if it's bowed then
it's the stroke comes from the top of the ascender and curves into the loop so
after doing all of that work i ended up with five scribes and the um the other
uh glyph that i used to make this distinction that was actually even more
determinative than the the k is um this up here that i've circled just this
last bit of the the letter form that in eda is transcribed as an n this last
bit so if you look at what happens with this bow it's quite different this
video is quite different from one scribe to another so inscribe one it has this
very long open broad bow scribe two it's much tighter scribe three it almost
closes completely right there scribe four there's a sharp angle right here like
a 45 degree angle and then it comes up and then on scribe five it's just this
long flat finial that hardly goes up at all but it extends quite far to the
left and that's really really consistent from hand to hand so the whenever you
see that that finial on the end that's scribe five whenever you see this video
on the end that's where i'm too that that is actually uh sufficient to
distinguish between these hands and then of course you have to add in all of
the other features to confirm uh what you've determined but in my work it seems
that the that one letter form is sufficient to define what's happening in all
the different um what's happening in all the different hands now where things
really get weird and now we're getting weird is when you start to look at how
the hands are uh how the different scribal corpora manifests themselves in the
manuscript this is where it's just wacko scenery is nodding because it is it's
wacko so here's how this works so i'm going to go choir by choir and
fortunately the manuscript does have um choir there we go it has signatures
added a little bit later after one of the rebindings but it does have
signatures so that's of course super helpful for determining the codecological
structure of the manuscript and this wonderful facsimile over here actually
reproduces the bifolia choir structure of the manuscript with the sewing and in
fact if you could take it apart you would see that these are conjoined this
page is conjoined with this leaf this leaf is conjoined with that leaf and so
on so you can then start to map out how different hands um appear phone
ecologically throughout the manuscript and it's it's weird i'll show you so
we're going to start with the botanical section choirs one through eight so
this is using an application called this call that allows you to visualize the
bifolia of a manuscript as if it were taken apart and you had scattered it on
the table in front of you which of course we're not going to do but if you
could do that this is what it would look like so what we're looking at here is
acquire one for bifolia um we've you know we've talked about um by fully
acquire structure so we've got four bifolia this is the first one right here
leaf one conjoint with leaf eight so what we're looking at here are is leaf one
and leaf eight so one rectangle is conjoined with a versa and one verso is
conjoined with a rectum so that's that's what these diagrams show you so the
first few quads are entirely scribed one there's fire one here's choir two
here's fire three now when we get to choir three this is when everything gets
black out so in choir three we see scribe two for the first time and scribe two
writes the entire second bifolia the whole bifolia the front and the back all
four cages both leaves of the bifolium that's in the middle of this choir now
that's crazy that is just so not the way that medieval manuscripts work you
just don't see that and i've actually got here a uh a mock-up uh that that
shows how this works so for this exact wire so sorry folio 25 here's the
central bifolium so in in this diagram that's the one at the bottom so that's
this one down here at the bottom so this is the central bifolium both sides of
this portfolium are written by scribe one here's the next bifolium all that
written by scrub one then we get to the third bifolia that's this one the one
outlined in red this all of this is written by scrub two then we go back to
scribe one all of this written by spread one stack them up fold them through
the middle and there's your quiet now in a regular medieval manuscript you
would not see scribes mixed this way you might see them mixed but they wouldn't
be mixed by by folia it just doesn't make sense for the way that medieval
manuscripts are produced the implication is that the leaves are outward that
somewhere somewhere in the history of the manuscript the bifolia got mixed up
and it was rebound early on in the wrong order and the reason we know the
rebinding happened really early oh here's a perfect example if you zoom in
right here so here is um this is scribe one over here scribe two over here
right here is an offset of this flower so these have been facing they've been
stuck looking at each other when the book is closed the services have been
touching for a really really long time uh and so this or this early rebinding
happened a very very long time ago um before the folio numbers were added so
now we're starting to put together a kind of a code ecological history of the
book so it was at some point it was rebound at some point the bifolia were miss
ordered and then the uh foliation was added and then some leaves were lost so
that tells you something already about the the history of the of the object
there's also this really catastrophic water stain in the upper margins of the
first 40 or 50 leads that predates the addition of the folio numbers so the
folio numbers happen after the water state so maybe the water stain was the
reason the book was rebound in the first place uh and then it was rebound out
of order and then the water then the foliation was added and then the leaves
get lost we don't know um but there are there's there's evidence code
ecological evidence that helps you to piece together all of these um all of
these events of this this trauma in the history of the manuscript all right so
then we continue to see this mixing of scribe what inspired to for the next few
choirs until we get to choir 4 when um squad 5 makes an appearance for the
first time scribe 5 does only the outer bifolium so here again we have another
example of the scribe the scribes doing entire bifolia and the bifolia being
being mixed in this really bizarre and unprecedented way at least as far as i
know all right here's seven is scrub one and two then we get just to uh eight
we're missing a bunch of bifolia here so we have the outermost bifolium and
then the next one and then because the foliation has been skipped you can tell
that there are in fact three bifolia that are missing or six leaves and in this
case we've got um scribe five has written one side of the bifolium and one page
of the other side and then scribe one does 57v which is that wacko page where
uh this one where all of those unique letter forms were that's scribe one and
then scribe three does the other bifolium that this is mixed with so here we've
got three scribes mixed up in unusual ways uh all right then we get to this
section the astronomical astrological section entirely written by a new scribe
scrub four writes all of this and that includes the um uh wait where am i all
right okay then the boundary logical section which is a very large choir of um
eight by folia and one two sorry five bifolia so ten leaves uh entirely written
by scrub two the whole thing then we get to the big fold out uh where if we
jump ahead here after the valentia logical section here we go so here's the
fold out the fold out this side of it is entirely written by scribe before the
other side so here you can see three pages of the other side plus this plus
this page and these two it's kind of hard to visualize uh unless you can see it
unfolded like it is there so the other side is entirely scribed too so here we
have one very large sheet in which scribe two inscribed four collaborated where
scribe two did one side squad four did the other side then we have uh sort of a
um these kind of random fold outs that that don't seem to belong together that
are probably out of order uh nested by uh botanicals and the recipes all by
scribe one then we have some more botanicals uh one by folium by scribe two
nested with a by fold out by scribe three and then uh several fold outs two
nested fold outs of recipes by scribe one and then we get to the very last
section those starred paragraphs where we have uh mostly scribe three at work
this was a like mega choir uh at this point it's one two three four five six it
was originally seven nested by folia that's a lot um and the entire thing is
written by scribe three except when we get to folio 115 and so i'm going to ask
you to buy us to zoom in here let's look at folio 115 versa 14 15 115 verso
okay so here if you look really carefully you can see something happens after
the first 11 or so lines when we get to what looks like a new paragraph i hold
it this is effectively so i can do this so you've got all of this and then a
change so we have a change of scribe from from right here to there and this is
one of those moments where you're going back and forth and you could convince
yourself that every line is by a different scribe but i'm pretty convinced that
what we're looking at here is scribe two on the first 12 to 15 or so lines and
then we return to scribe three and you can see that uh there that's what i'm
talking about in the slides so here we have yet another we have another example
of where scribe 2 collaborates with another scribe on the same on the same um
folio so that i think may tell us something about scribe 2 um i don't know what
but something scribe 2 is is a collaborator throughout the manuscript so that's
it that's our those are our scribes that's how they make their way through the
manuscript and how the um the code ecological structure is just so strange that
uh it can only suggest that some kind of intervention has happened that
somewhere in its history the manuscript was bound out of order there's a lot of
interest in looking at the um these offsets the like the one i just showed you
on wherever it was 34 30 31. these um these places where the um one side we
want you to see it there oh here we are where the the pigment from one page has
been offset in a mirror image on the other so if you could find for example an
offset here that matched a leaf 15 leaves before that would be really solid
evidence of the original sequence of leaves of the manuscript so far
unfortunately that has not come to fruition but it's something that i continue
to work on to see if i can find any places where there are there are offsets
that that don't match what is actually across from them now um and find other
place in the manuscript my suspicion is that originally entire choirs were by
scribe one entire choirs by scribe two perhaps an entire choir by scribe three
that's my suspicion uh it seems sensible but how that actually plays out i
couldn't tell you but it does have some significance for people who are trying
to solve the manuscript if they don't know what order the leaves go in you
can't make you can't expect it to make semantic to make it to expect it to make
sense if you don't know what what sequence the leaves originally went in now
the last thing i want to do is show you how these linguistic determinations
between language a and language b's there are some some places where it's
really easy to tell the difference um can you make my slideshow bigger because
that's what we're going to look at now there we go so uh here we have a bench
gallows so the gallows with two loops and two legs interfixed in this stretched
bench and that is very rare in dialect b but quite common in dialect a
inscribed one or language a so that's one distinctive uh characteristic between
dialect a and dialect b and then here's another one this one is even is really
dramatic the uh what in eda is d y looks like eight nine um at the end of a
word is so common in language b dialect b almost it's so common as to almost be
unimaginable statistically it's really uh dramatic how often you see that
ending in dialect b and it's incredibly rare in dialect a and then a minute
claire i'm going to toss it over to you to talk about that but let me just get
through this last one uh and then finally this question of the of the qo very
very common throughout the manuscript in both uh language a and language b
except in the pages written by scribe 4 where it's very very rare so that's uh
another kind of sub category that would be interesting to investigate about why
is it because of the content of those pages that might have something to do
with it or is it because of the the version of buena cheese that scribe 4 uses
that combination that q o glyph is just not needed as uh as frequently i think
that's the last one yes okay so claire i'm going to toss it over to you if you
want to chat a little bit about that oh sure yeah so i guess with um so with
scribe four and the um the qo to to start with um there's been a suggestion
that um most of what scribe four is writing um uh labels um of um so uh so we
have the um some of the astrological diagrams and the um zodiacal diagrams and
so if those are basically labels labels might have either a different case or
they might not have articles depending on the language things like that um and
so that might lead to a different structure for um for those pages um and so
there are things that um uh lead to lead to differences in um in the sorts of
statistics we're looking at just because of the genre or because of the subject
matter and not because of the underlying dialect or anything like that and
that's one of the issues with uh with using some of these methods for um for
studying the voynich manuscript because all of these things when we when we use
them on wikipedia text or we use them on wall street journal corpora or things
like that we kind of know what's underlying it um and so we can abstract away
from the things that might lead to really um problematic differences whereas we
can't do any of that for uh for the one inch manuscript um another thing that i
wanted to mention was um so with um lisa's scribal identification um i teach a
class on the voynich manuscript every couple of years and um the students do
final projects on things that interest them and um last year some a group of
students who were majoring in computer science and um statistics and data
science did a topic modeling analysis of the voynich manuscript so they took
the um the transcribed data and um we looked at page level and paragraph level
and and so on and used um document summation techniques to uh to figure out um
what are the what are the main groups of pages and um we did this without
putting any information in so you know we know we know something about the
groups of pages um from the illustrations um either because we don't have
illustrations or because um we have botanical illustrations or bioneological
illustrations etc um and um so we found that uh the combination topics alone uh
so so we got our topics through um through computational measures which i'm
happy to talk about but it's a little involved so um so just assume
computational measures for now but i'm very happy to explain in more detail but
basically it's picking out the um the most distinctive vocabulary in um in each
set of pages um so these are used these methods are used for instance to um
make summaries of medical records or of um articles or um uh of um reviews on
amazon or or things like that so we were using these techniques for the for the
voynich manuscript and um using these um uh term frequency um like uh keywords
for um for different sections we um we came up with um uh with five or six
sections um but the pages that were grouped together um didn't exactly match
the um the pages from the barney logical section or the pages from the
botanical section etc it was only when we started looking at lisa's scribal
identification and looking at the combination of subject matter um as
identified by the illustrations and the hands together that we were able to um
to make sense of these groupings and then in that case they made a lot of sense
so for instance scribe four who's doing mostly labels doing mostly
illustrations and diagrams and so on always stood out as um as being basically
a topic on their own group on their own um but with the um uh herb um uh the
yeah the herbal sections um the uh only like splitting up scribe threes from uh
from scribe ones and so on was uh uh uh also divided up the topics for uh for
the for the analysis um and so that that i thought was a really nice uh
independent validation both of the hand um material and uh yeah of the um of
the the fact that we were identifying some sort of either subject matter or
coding principles or something like that that were that were picking out
differences amongst the uh the different pages and that's so helpful for me
because my work i may still refine this right i mean i published it but i'm
publishing something else about it and i'll probably publish about this again
you know and this work this work is is is is refinable right and so looking at
the you know i'm so grateful to claire and their students for sort of digging
into my own results and putting them to the test that's really what i want i
want to there to be a confirmation or rejection right i want to know if any of
these attributions make no sense at all if they're totally contrary to the
linguistic analysis then i'm going to go back and refine them um because
pornography is is is a lot about judgment it's about the human eye it's not
really a science in that way in that there's it's really subjective in a lot of
ways so i'm always happy to be to be put to the test and and have the
opportunity to refine my way all right so i think that's
