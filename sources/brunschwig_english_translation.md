A toad came crawling in seeking bread to eat, following the smell. It stopped at the threshold. A spider came down from above and stung it - the toad cried out. Those watching saw the toad bite off some plantain herb. It came back and was stung again - and ate the herb again. The third time, one person jumped out the window and removed the plantain. When the toad returned and could not find the herb, it swelled up and immediately died.
