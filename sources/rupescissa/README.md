## Background

John of Rupescissa (Jean de Roquetaillade, c. 1310-1366) was a Franciscan friar and alchemist. His **"De consideratione quintae essentiae"** (~1351-1352) introduced the concept of "quintessence" - distilled alcohol as a medicinal agent.

## Relevance to Voynich/Puff

Rupescissa's treatise is the **foundational text** of the medieval distillation tradition:

```
Rupescissa (~1351) -> Puff (~1455) -> Brunschwig (1500)
     |                    |               |
 Quintessence        83 chapters      Full process
   theory           WHAT to use      HOW to make
```

Puff explicitly references Rupescissa's theories while cataloging materials.
