CANON 1
============================================================

The first secret is this: by virtue of the power which God conferred upon
created nature, and subjected to human mastery, man can cure the discomforts
of old age--by which the works of the Evangelical life are too greatly
impeded in ancient Evangelical men--and restore lost youth, and recover
former strength, and regain it, though not to the same degree. This is a
greater secret than any in all of nature. How this is accomplished, we
shall demonstrate aptly in the following canon.

============================================================
CANON 2
============================================================

This is what all have labored to seek: a created thing fit for human use,
which can preserve the corruptible body from putrefaction; having preserved
it, conserve it without diminution; having conserved it, if possible,
perpetuate it in being. For this is what all naturally desire--never to be
corrupted, nor to die, as St. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5: "For we who are
in this tabernacle groan, being burdened, because we do not wish to be
unclothed, but rather clothed upon with the body itself, lest we die."

Since very few philosophers have arrived at the ultimate knowledge of such
a thing, it is evident that the physicians of our time--who burn with desire
for money and honors--have been able to confer nothing worthy upon any great
man of our time for money, nor can they. Nor does God wish that the greedy
should know.

But since, as Paul says in Hebrews 9, "It is appointed unto men once to die,"
it is therefore phantastical to labor so that in this mortal life we might
seek such a thing that could render our body immortal from mortal--as in
Genesis 3: "Lest Adam put forth his hand and take from the tree of life and
eat and live forever," God expelled him from the paradise of pleasure to
work the earth from which he was taken, and placed before the paradise of
pleasure the Cherubim with a flaming sword, turning every way, to guard the
way to the tree of life.

It would be phantastical therefore to say that God would give Adam, outside
paradise, some thing by which he could live forever, since He cast him out
precisely so he would not take of the fruit of the tree of life and live
forever.

This we hold infallibly from the text: God has appointed for each person a
terminus which cannot be exceeded by any human ingenuity or aid, as Job says:
"The days of man are short; the number of his months is with you; you have
appointed his limits which cannot be passed."

Therefore that aid to life for prolonging the terminus would be phantastical
and vain. IT REMAINS THEREFORE TO SEEK A THING WHICH, SHORT OF THE TERMINUS
OF OUR LIFE PREFIXED BY GOD, CAN PRESERVE OUR BODY WITHOUT CORRUPTION, HEAL
IT, AND CONSERVE IT; CURE THE INFIRM, RESTORE WHAT IS LOST, UNTIL THE FINAL
DAY OF DEATH COMES AT THE TERMINUS PREFIXED BY GOD.

Reason dictates that to wish to preserve the corruptible body by a putrid
and corruptible thing, to form a thing by a thing subject to deformity, to
make the incorruptible by a deficient thing, to heal the infirm by an infirm
thing, to make the foul beautiful by a fetid thing, to make the weak firm by
a weak thing--THIS IS PHANTASTICAL AND VAIN.

Therefore the root of life is to seek a thing which (if it stood in eternity)
would be of itself incorruptible; which would keep every thing united to it
always incorrupt; which would nourish, increase, and restore the virtue of
life and spirit; which would digest everything crude and reduce everything
digested to equality; which would cut off any excess of whichever quality,
and restore whichever quality is lost; which would make the natural moisture
abound, and cause the weak natural fire to be inflamed.

KNOW WITHOUT FALSITY THAT NONE OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS IS SUCH A THING, nor
anything that includes in itself the material composition of elements,
because all such things are subject to corruption and transmutation.

We must therefore seek a thing which relates to the four qualities of which
our body is composed, AS THE HEAVENS RELATE TO THE FOUR ELEMENTS. The
philosophers called the heavens the QUINTA ESSENTIA (Fifth Essence) with
respect to the four elements, because the heavens are in themselves
incorruptible and immutable, receiving no foreign impressions except by
God's command.

So also the thing we seek is, with respect to the four qualities of our
body, A FIFTH ESSENCE--in itself made incorruptible: not hot and dry with
fire, nor humid and cold with water, nor hot and humid with air, nor cold
and dry with earth. But it is a Fifth Essence, effective against contraries,
just as the incorruptible heaven, when necessary, infuses humid quality,
sometimes hot, sometimes cold, sometimes dry.

SUCH IS THE ROOT OF LIFE, THE FIFTH ESSENCE, WHICH THE MOST HIGH CREATED
IN NATURE so that it might supply the necessity of the body short of that
final terminus which God has appointed for our life.

And I said that the Most High created the Fifth Essence, which is extracted
from the body of nature created by God with human artifice. I shall name it
by its three names given by the philosophers:

   1. AQUA ARDENS (burning water)
   2. ANIMA VINI SEU SPIRITUS (soul or spirit of wine)
   3. AQUA VITAE (water of life)

And when you wish to conceal it, you shall call it QUINTA ESSENTIA, because
this its nature and this its highest name the philosophers wished to reveal
to no one, but let the truth be buried with them.

That it is not humid like the element of water is demonstrated, because it
BURNS--which is repugnant to elemental water. That it is not hot and humid
like air is declared, because dry air is corrupted by anything, as is evident
in the generation of spiders and flies--but this always remains incorrupt if
kept sealed from evaporation. That it is not dry and cold like earth is
expressly demonstrated, because it supremely sharpens and supremely heats.
That it is not hot and dry like fire is demonstrated to the eye: because
being hot, it cools, and hot diseases it diminishes and annuls, as I shall
prove below.

That it confers incorruptibility and preserves from corruptibility, I shall
demonstrate from experience: for if any bird, or piece of flesh, or fish is
immersed in it, IT WILL NOT CORRUPT in perpetuity if kept sealed.

============================================================
CHAPTER 9 - METHODS OF SEPARATING THE QUINTESSENCE
============================================================

The first method, and principal of all, is that which was already revealed
above, to which none is equal.

SECOND METHOD: Take the most noble aqua ardens [burning water/alcohol], the
strongest you can obtain, and put it in a glass amphora with a very long
neck. Seal the opening very firmly with wax, filled to half or a third. Then
bury it completely in the belly of a prepared horse [horse manure, for gentle
heat], inverted so the neck with wax is below and the bottom above. By the
virtue of the heat of horse dung, the quinta essentia will rise upward toward
the bottom of the amphora, and the gross matter will descend to the neck below.

After many days when you wish to extract it, lift the amphora gently and you
will see the thickness and clarity, and the difference between the sublimated
quinta essentia and the gross matter residing in the neck.

THE METHOD OF SEPARATION (marvelous and ingenious): Take a sharp iron stylus
and pierce the wax hanging at the mouth of the amphora facing the ground, and
perforate through to the liquid. When you have pierced it, withdraw the stylus,
and first the terrestrial water in the neck will exit, until it has all come
out up to the division you noted between it and the elevated quinta essentia.
When you see the quinta essentia about to flow out, quickly place your finger
over the hole and invert the amphora--you will have the quinta essentia inside
and the terrestrial water extracted separately.

THIS IS THE GREATEST MASTERY, AND AMONG THE MOST SECRET OF SECRETS.

And that quinta essentia does not attain to the value of the first [method],
but it is very noble. Use it discreetly, because the greatest virtue is in it,
which you seek.

THIRD METHOD: Take a large glass amphora and place it well-sealed in the belly
of a horse, completely buried. The purity of the quinta essentia will rise,
and the gross will remain at the bottom. Extract gently what floats, and reduce
the residue to fire.

FOURTH METHOD: Take any vessel of glass or of strongly vitrified earth (which
costs little), and place above it a round glass foot with a stem, and seal the
vessel with its cover, and let the rod of the glass foot hang inside the vessel
in the air, so that what rises like bubbling oil to the cover may descend again
through the glass foot to the interior of the vessel. This instrument you can
make anywhere without tedious expense, and it is a supplement to the circulation
vessel described above, because that cannot always be obtained.

FIFTH METHOD: Let the water be distilled at least three times up to seven times,
and continuously digested in the belly of a horse.

SIXTH METHOD: Have at least the best simple water distilled once or twice that
you can obtain.

SEVENTH METHOD: Take water...

KEY CONCEPTS SUMMARY
============================================================

QUINTA ESSENTIA (Fifth Essence):
- The incorruptible celestial element made accessible on earth
- Extracted from wine through repeated distillation
- Neither hot/cold/wet/dry like the four elements
- Preserves from corruption what is immersed in it
- Balances all qualities - restores what is lacking, removes excess

THREE NAMES FOR THE SAME SUBSTANCE:
1. Aqua ardens - "burning water" (it combusts, unlike water)
2. Anima vini / Spiritus - "soul/spirit of wine"
3. Aqua vitae - "water of life"

THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENT:
- The four elements are corruptible; nothing made of them can preserve
- The heavens (quinta essentia) are incorruptible
- Therefore we must find an earthly substance with heavenly properties
- Distilled alcohol has these properties: it burns (not water),
  preserves flesh (incorruptible), heats and cools (balances qualities)

THEOLOGICAL CAVEAT:
- Cannot extend life beyond God's appointed terminus
- But CAN preserve health and cure disease up to that limit
- This is lawful and not "phantastical"

DISTILLATION TRADITION:
  Rupescissa (~1351) -> Puff (~1455) -> Brunschwig (1500)
