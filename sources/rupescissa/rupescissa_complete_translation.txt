LIBER PRIMUS
DE CONSIDERATIONE QUINTAE ESSENTIAE OMNIUM RERUM

THE FIRST BOOK
ON THE CONSIDERATION OF THE FIFTH ESSENCE OF ALL THINGS

Handed down to the poor and Evangelical men, servants of our Lord Jesus
Christ, composed by Master John of Rupescissa, Professor of Sacred Theology
and distinguished Philosopher.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROOEMIUM (PREFACE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solomon said in Wisdom chapter 7: "God gave me true knowledge of the things
that are, that I might know the disposition of the whole world, and the
virtues of the elements, the beginning, the consummation, and the middle of
times, the alterations of the turning of things, and the changes of seasons,
the courses of the year, and the positions of the stars, the natures of
animals, and the rage of beasts, the force of winds, and the thoughts of men,
the differences of plants and the virtues of roots: and all such things as
are hidden and unforeseen I have learned: for Wisdom, the artificer of all
things, taught me this alone."

And the same Solomon in Proverbs chapter 16 says: "God has wrought all things
for himself." Therefore demonstratively, supposing the infallibility of
Scripture, it is concluded that all Philosophy, which the Spirit of the Lord
revealed to Solomon in the words set forth above, is to be usefully applied
to the service of God and of the Gospel of Christ and of Evangelical men, and
to the devoted service of the whole mystical body of Christ. And thus briefly
the title of this book is concluded and proven.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTHOR'S INTENTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have considered therefore that the time spent in the pursuit of worldly
Philosophy for more than five years before entering the Order in the most
flourishing studium of Toulouse, and more than another five since I entered
this Order with much noise of vain words and conflict of useless disputations
and vain praise and foolish glory of lectures, both in particular studies and
in general ones reading, as it is possible to redeem that time, I shall
redeem it, restore what was lost, and bring back what has elapsed to hand,
that from it I may extract, by the justice of Jesus Christ, merit profitable
for eternal glory.

And I saw a possible way in this: if the utilities which I saw in Philosophy
by divine spirit illuminating, even in the time of my youth, at which time
the merciful and compassionate God was with me beyond measure, I might reveal
to the poor of Christ and to Evangelical men, so that those who have despised
riches for the sake of the Gospel might know easily, without human doctrine,
and lightly, and without notable expenses, how to heal their bodily miseries
and human infirmities by divine kindness; to wonderfully drive away
impediments to holy prayer and meditation; to resist even the temptations of
demons, which they inflict on account of certain infirmities; so that in all
things and through all things they may be able expeditiously to serve our
Lord Jesus Christ most devoutly with all their strength.

And since I make this work FOR THE SAINTS ALONE, from which work, God
commanding, they will receive such great goods, it is concluded evidently
that I shall be a participant in their benefits, prayers, and merits which
they will more greatly perform with the help of this book (by the justice of
Christ and his command), whether they will or not: because whatever is the
cause of a cause is the cause of what is caused.

I humbly and with contrite heart beg with all my strength that most clement
God who revealed to me, unworthy and most vile sinner and fallen one, many
secrets of worldly Philosophy, that HE NOT PERMIT THIS BOOK TO COME INTO THE
HANDS OF THE UNWORTHY, THE VAIN, AND THE GREEDY, and of those who wish to
have money and not give remedies: but rather of those who wish to give
remedies in view of God's mercy and piety alone to the saints, the worthy,
the good, and the just, for holy and Evangelical works more vigorously to be
done.

And may God and our Lord Jesus Christ IMPEDE THOSE WISHING TO DO THE CONTRARY
so that the effect does not follow, as the greedy man hopes. Oh how great an
evil it would be if this book came into the hands of worldly men, and to the
notice of tyrants, and to the service of the reprobate: because just as the
saints through this book will be able to continue the works of the life of
Christ longer and more vehemently, so also the reprobate would be able by
perverse use to persevere longer in evil.

But I, as far as it is in me, CONSTITUTE THIS BOOK FOR THE SAINTS ALONE, and
I commend it to Jesus Christ to guard, without other words approaching the
revelation of secrets, according to the order of titles to be written below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CANON 1 (THE FIRST SECRET)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first secret is this: that by virtue of the power which God conferred
upon created nature, and subjected to human mastery, MAN CAN CURE THE
DISCOMFORTS OF OLD AGE by which the works of the Evangelical life are too
greatly impeded in ancient Evangelical men, AND RESTORE LOST YOUTH, AND
RECOVER FORMER STRENGTH, and regain it, though not to the same degree.

This is a greater secret than any in all of nature.

How this is accomplished, we shall demonstrate aptly in the following canon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CANON 2 (WHAT ALL HAVE SOUGHT)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is what all have labored to seek: a created thing fit for human use,
which can:
  - PRESERVE the corruptible body from putrefaction
  - Having preserved it, CONSERVE it without diminution
  - Having conserved it, if possible, PERPETUATE it in being

For this is what all naturally desire: never to be corrupted, nor to die, as
St. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5: "For we who are in this tabernacle groan,
being burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed, but rather clothed
upon with the body itself, lest we die."

Since very few philosophers have arrived at the ultimate knowledge of such a
thing, it is evident that the PHYSICIANS OF OUR TIME -- who burn with desire
for money and honors -- have been able to confer nothing worthy upon any
great man of our time for money, nor can they.

NOR DOES GOD WISH THAT THE GREEDY SHOULD KNOW.

But since, as Paul says in Hebrews 9, "It is appointed unto men once to die,"
it is therefore PHANTASTICAL to labor so that in this mortal life we might
seek such a thing that could render our body immortal from mortal -- as in
Genesis 3: "Lest Adam put forth his hand and take from the tree of life and
eat and live forever," God expelled him from the paradise of pleasure to work
the earth from which he was taken, and placed before the paradise of pleasure
the Cherubim with a flaming sword, turning every way, to guard the way to the
tree of life.

This we hold infallibly from the text: God has appointed for each person a
TERMINUS which cannot be exceeded by any human ingenuity or aid, as Job says:
"The days of man are short; the number of his months is with you; you have
appointed his limits which cannot be passed."

Therefore that aid to life for prolonging the terminus would be phantastical
and vain.

IT REMAINS THEREFORE TO SEEK A THING WHICH, SHORT OF THE TERMINUS OF OUR LIFE
PREFIXED BY GOD, CAN:
  - Preserve our body without corruption
  - Heal it and conserve it
  - Cure the infirm
  - Restore what is lost
  - Until the final day of death comes at the terminus prefixed by God

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reason dictates that to wish to:
  - Preserve the corruptible body by a putrid and corruptible thing
  - Form a thing by a thing subject to deformity
  - Make the incorruptible by a deficient thing
  - Heal the infirm by an infirm thing
  - Make the foul beautiful by a fetid thing
  - Make the weak firm by a weak thing

THIS IS PHANTASTICAL AND VAIN.

Therefore the root of life is to seek a thing which (if it stood in eternity)
would be of itself incorruptible:
  - Which would keep every thing united to it always incorrupt
  - Which would nourish, increase, and restore the virtue of life and spirit
  - Which would digest everything crude and reduce everything digested to
    equality
  - WHICH WOULD CUT OFF ANY EXCESS OF WHICHEVER QUALITY
  - AND RESTORE WHICHEVER QUALITY IS LOST
  - Which would make the natural moisture abound
  - And cause the weak natural fire to be inflamed

KNOW WITHOUT FALSITY THAT NONE OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS IS SUCH A THING, nor
anything that includes in itself the material composition of elements,
because all such things are subject to corruption and transmutation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE QUINTA ESSENTIA DEFINED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We must therefore seek a thing which relates to the four qualities of which
our body is composed, AS THE HEAVENS RELATE TO THE FOUR ELEMENTS.

The philosophers called the heavens the QUINTA ESSENTIA (Fifth Essence) with
respect to the four elements, because the heavens are in themselves:
  - INCORRUPTIBLE
  - IMMUTABLE
  - Receiving no foreign impressions except by God's command

So also the thing we seek is, with respect to the four qualities of our body,
A FIFTH ESSENCE -- in itself made incorruptible:
  - NOT hot and dry with fire
  - NOR humid and cold with water
  - NOR hot and humid with air
  - NOR cold and dry with earth

But it is a FIFTH ESSENCE, effective against contraries, just as the
incorruptible heaven, when necessary, infuses humid quality, sometimes hot,
sometimes cold, sometimes dry.

SUCH IS THE ROOT OF LIFE, THE FIFTH ESSENCE, WHICH THE MOST HIGH CREATED IN
NATURE so that it might supply the necessity of the body short of that final
terminus which God has appointed for our life.

And I said that the Most High created the Fifth Essence, which is extracted
from the body of nature created by God WITH HUMAN ARTIFICE.

I shall name it by its THREE NAMES given by the philosophers:

  1. AQUA ARDENS (burning water)
  2. ANIMA VINI SEU SPIRITUS (soul or spirit of wine)
  3. AQUA VITAE (water of life)

AND WHEN YOU WISH TO CONCEAL IT, YOU SHALL CALL IT QUINTA ESSENTIA, because
this its nature and this its highest name THE PHILOSOPHERS WISHED TO REVEAL
TO NO ONE, but let the truth be buried with them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROOF THAT QUINTESSENCE IS NOT OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That it is NOT HUMID like the element of water is demonstrated:
  - Because IT BURNS -- which is repugnant to elemental water

That it is NOT HOT AND HUMID like air is declared:
  - Because dry air is corrupted by anything, as is evident in the generation
    of spiders and flies
  - But this ALWAYS REMAINS INCORRUPT if kept sealed from evaporation

That it is NOT DRY AND COLD like earth is expressly demonstrated:
  - Because it supremely sharpens and supremely heats

That it is NOT HOT AND DRY like fire is demonstrated to the eye:
  - Because being hot, it cools, and hot diseases it diminishes and annuls

That it CONFERS INCORRUPTIBILITY and preserves from corruptibility, I shall
demonstrate from experience:
  - For if any bird, or piece of flesh, or fish is immersed in it
  - IT WILL NOT CORRUPT in perpetuity if kept sealed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER III: THE SEARCH FOR THE SUN (GOLD)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And just as the highest heaven does not influence only through itself for
conservation in the world and wondrous influences, but through the virtue of
the sun and other stars: so also this heaven, the Fifth Essence, wishes to be
adorned with a wondrous sun, splendid and incorruptible and equalized: a sun
upon which not even fire itself can act to corrupt it.

And I say to you in unfeigned charity and good conscience that this sun,
illuminated, splendid, and incorruptible by fire, which influences
incorruptibility and the root of life in the manner which is possible, as I
explained above in our body, which was created for the adornment of our
heaven and for augmenting the influence of the Fifth Essence -- IT CAN BE
GRASPED BY HAND, and the King of glory has established it in the power of
mortals.

And I, on account of the charity of God, speaking to Evangelical men, will
reveal it to you by its proper and intelligible name: IT IS THE GOLD OF GOD,
which is composed from the Philosophers' Stone and is wholly converted into
nutriment.

But that gold which is collected from the veins of the earth or from rivers
is not converted into nutriment, but is excreted as it is taken. And
alchemical gold, which is composed of corrosives, destroys nature.

Therefore the gold of the Stone is called THE GOLD OF GOD. For the sun is the
son of the sun of heaven, from which the Philosophers' Stone is composed. For
it is generated from the influences of the sun in the bowels of the earth,
and the sun from its influence gives it an incorruptible nature and color of
substance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER IV: THE SEARCH FOR THE STARS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the witness Solomon says in Ecclesiastes chapter 1: "All things are
difficult, and man cannot explain them by speech."

Among all things which God created wondrous in this world and supremely
stupendous and rightly to be admired, there are certain medicinal species
having the virtue of attracting superfluous humors FROM ONE MEMBER AND NOT
FROM ANOTHER -- as that hierapicra [bitter sacred remedy] attracts humors
from the head, neck, and chest, and not from the navel and below, and certain
others from the navel below, and not from the upper region of members.

And how and in what manner this happens is so difficult even to the greatest
Philosophers that Johannes Ibn Masawayh [Mesue] in his book on Simple
Medicines near the beginning says that NO CAUSE IS TO BE SOUGHT except that
they have this from heaven, and in what manner and from what part of heaven,
they do not know how to assign.

Consider and see how sailors of the sea, rubbing a needle with a lodestone,
make it turn toward the pole star. Whence does the needle have this, that it
always turns toward that star without fail, and turns to no other place?

Without doubt this is because both iron and magnet, by the command and empire
of God through the influence of that star, are generated in the earth, and
they have in themselves the nature and influence and property of the star:
and therefore, as toward its like, the needle always turns toward it.

Whence is it that whenever the moon rises, always without fail the tide of
the sea begins to rise? And when the moon reaches the middle of the sky, it
begins to fall? And when the moon reaches the west it begins to rise again,
until the moon reaches the angle of the earth, where it begins to fall, until
the moon rises again?

Therefore, if with the Fifth Essence and sun you wish to cure your infirm
head, you will augment the influence of the Fifth Essence and its sun with
OUR STARS, which are generated under the influence of the stars of the sign
of Aries, like hierapicra and similar things which aid the head.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER V: HOW TO MAKE AQUA ARDENS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not think me to have uttered a lie because I named the Fifth Essence
"aqua ardens" [burning water] and said that none of the modern Philosophers
and physicians have attained to it, since aqua ardens is commonly found
everywhere.

For I spoke the truth certainly. For THE MASTERY OF THE FIFTH ESSENCE IS
HIDDEN, and I have seen only one most approved Theologian who understood
anything of its secret and mastery.

And I affirm as true that THE FIFTH ESSENCE IS AQUA ARDENS AND IS NOT AQUA
ARDENS. And may the God of heaven put prudence in the hearts of the
Evangelical men for whom I construct this book, that they not share with the
reprobate this venerable secret of God.

Behold, now I open to you the truth:

You shall not take wine too watery, nor black wine, earthy and insipid, but
NOBLE WINE, pleasant, sapid, and fragrant, the best that can be found. And
distill it in stills so many times until you have made the best aqua ardens
that you know how to make -- say, from three times up to seven times you
distill it.

THIS IS THE AQUA ARDENS TO WHICH THE MODERN PHYSICIANS HAVE NOT ATTAINED.

This water is the MATTER from which the Fifth Essence is extracted, which we
principally intend in this book.

Because after you have your noble water, you will have fabricated in the
furnace of glassmakers a distillatory such as this: ALL INTACT, of one piece
with only one opening above, through which the water is put in and extracted.

For you see the instrument so wondrously formed that what by virtue of fire
ascends and distills into the vessel through the arm-channels, is again
carried back so that it may ascend again, and descend again, CONTINUOUSLY DAY
AND NIGHT, until the aqua ardens is converted by God's will into Fifth
Essence from heaven.

And the understanding of the operation is in this: because the best aqua
ardens which can be made by the common operation of the vulgar still has a
material mixture of the four elements.

And therefore it is devised by divine inspiration that THROUGH CONTINUOUS
ASCENTS AND DESCENTS the Fifth Essence which we seek is separated from the
corruptible composition of the four elements.

And this happens because that which is sublimated a second time and often is
more subtle and glorified, and more separated from the corruption of the four
elements, than when it only ascends once.

And so UP TO A THOUSAND TIMES, and through continuous ascent and descent,
what is sublimated comes to such a height of glorification that it becomes a
COMPOUND ALMOST INCORRUPTIBLE LIKE HEAVEN, and of the nature of heaven, and
therefore is called Fifth Essence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER VI: PRACTICE - SIGNS OF SUCCESSFUL QUINTESSENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the circular distillation has been done for many days in the
circulation vessel described above, you will open the opening of the vessel
which is at the top (which was sealed with a seal composed of lute of wisdom,
made from the finest flour and egg white and from damp paper most diligently
carded and mixed, so that it could never breathe out in any way).

And when you have opened the opening, IF THE ODOR, which ought to be beyond
wondrous -- so that no worldly fragrance can equal it, which will seem to
have descended as from the sublimity of the most glorious God -- to such an
extent that if the vessel is placed in the corner of a house, FROM THE
FRAGRANCE OF THE FIFTH ESSENCE (which is wondrous and supremely miraculous)
IT ATTRACTS TO ITSELF BY AN INVISIBLE BOND ALL WHO ENTER THERE:

YOU HAVE THE FIFTH ESSENCE which you have heard of, to which none of the
modern Philosophers and physicians, as far as I could know, have attained,
except the one whom I excepted above.

But if you do not find the odor and the influence of attraction of men as I
said, seal the vessel as before and return it to the heat described above,
that through the sublimations and circulation of that wondrous vessel you may
arrive at what is desired.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER VII: FIRE WITHOUT FIRE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because we intend to console in this our book the poor Evangelical men, so
that they do not lose prayer in this labor, nor be occupied in the
preparation of such things, I shall bring forth for them from the belly of
the secret treasures of nature a truly wondrous and venerable thing:

NAMELY, HEAT WITHOUT FIRE AND WITHOUT CHARCOAL, so that in it our Fifth
Essence may be generated.

The most wise founder of the world created two things most apt for this.

FIRST METHOD (HORSE DUNG):
You will receive THE BELLY OF A HORSE very well digested -- I mean to say, O
man of God, the best dung of a horse -- and you will pack it into some vessel
or pit made in the earth lined throughout, made of ashes. And in the middle
of the well-packed dung, you will place the distillatory vessel of
circulation up to the middle or more.

Because it is necessary that the whole head of the vessel remain placed in
the cold air, so that what ascends by virtue of the heat of dung, there again
by virtue of the cold of air is converted into water, and falls, and ascends
again.

And thus WITHOUT EXPENSE you have FIRE WITHOUT FIRE, and continuous
circulation of the Fifth Essence, without great labor.

SECOND METHOD (GRAPE MUST):
Take the grape harvest expressed from the wine-press, and do through all
things as I taught above concerning the belly of the horse: because it has a
wondrous and divine heat.

THIRD METHOD (SOLAR HEAT):
Place the sealed circulation vessel under the strong reverberation of the sun
collected, and night and day allow it to rest without your labor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER VIII: OBTAINING AQUA ARDENS FROM SPOILED WINE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Most High created the Fifth Essence not only in aqua ardens, but also in
every thing wondrous, durable, having heavenly virtue.

Open, I beg you, your understanding that you may understand the truth:
because corruptible things are immediately corrupted unless they are
continually preserved by ordinance of the Creator from that Fifth Essence.

Therefore EXTRACT AQUA ARDENS FROM WINE, because with the aqua ardens the
Fifth Essence is extracted. And what remains in the distillation vessel is
not wine.

And therefore note that WHEN WINE IS TRANSMUTED INTO VINEGAR, this happens
when the Fifth Essence invisibly exits by evaporating through the pot. And
with the Fifth Essence departing, wine is converted into vinegar.

Therefore IN ALL PURE WINE, except acetous [vinegar-like], however putrid or
turbid or fetid, THE FIFTH ESSENCE IS PRESERVED. And this is true for
certain.

The full demonstration is this: place in a distillation vessel wine which was
good but is now turbid or putrid -- without any doubt from it you will
distill aqua ardens and the best.

Therefore it is of the highest caution for Evangelical men for this mastery
to seek such wines which are lost, as if for nothing, and thence extract our
divine mastery.

Note well what I say: wine turbid and putrefied from the putrefaction of a
certain watery humor thus corrupts wine with a feverish condition. But the
Fifth Essence, because it is in itself incorruptible by nature, is NOT
CORRUPTED by that corruption of wine, but is only absorbed by the greater
corrupted quantity.

Therefore the secret of the mastery is that you extract the incorrupt Fifth
Essence from the corrupt wine by sublimation, and leave the putrefaction of
the four elements of wine as dregs at the bottom of the vessel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER IX: SEVEN METHODS OF OBTAINING QUINTESSENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIRST METHOD (principal of all): That which was already revealed above, to
which none is equal.

SECOND METHOD: Take the most noble aqua ardens, the strongest you can obtain,
and put it in a glass amphora with a very long neck. Seal the opening very
firmly with wax, filled to half or a third. Then bury it completely in the
belly of a horse [horse manure], inverted so the neck with wax is below and
the bottom above.

By the virtue of the heat of horse dung, the quinta essentia will rise upward
toward the bottom of the amphora, and the gross matter will descend to the
neck below. After many days when you wish to extract it, lift the amphora
gently and you will see the thickness and clarity, and the difference between
the sublimated quinta essentia and the gross matter residing in the neck.

THE METHOD OF SEPARATION (marvelous and ingenious): Take a sharp iron stylus
and pierce the wax hanging at the mouth of the amphora facing the ground, and
perforate through to the liquid. When you have pierced it, withdraw the
stylus, and first the terrestrial water in the neck will exit, until it has
all come out up to the division you noted between it and the elevated quinta
essentia. When you see the quinta essentia about to flow out, quickly place
your finger over the hole and invert the amphora.

You will have the quinta essentia inside and the terrestrial water extracted
separately. THIS IS THE GREATEST MASTERY, AND AMONG THE MOST SECRET OF
SECRETS.

THIRD METHOD: Take a large glass amphora and place it well-sealed in the
belly of a horse, completely buried. The purity of the quinta essentia will
rise, and the gross will remain at the bottom. Extract gently what floats,
and reduce the residue to fire.

FOURTH METHOD: Take any vessel of glass or of strongly vitrified earth, and
place above it a round glass foot with a stem, and seal the vessel with its
cover, and let the rod of the glass foot hang inside the vessel in the air,
so that what rises like bubbling oil to the cover may descend again through
the glass foot to the interior of the vessel. This instrument you can make
anywhere without tedious expense.

FIFTH METHOD: Let the water be distilled at least three times up to seven
times, and continuously digested in the belly of a horse.

SIXTH METHOD: Have at least the best simple water distilled once or twice
that you can obtain.

SEVENTH METHOD: Take whatever water you find at hand, provided it burns:
because beyond measure all are effective, as we shall abundantly declare
below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER X: EXTRACTING QUINTESSENCE FROM BLOOD, FLESH, AND EGGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have heard what I revealed to you above from the greatest secrets,
when I said that in every thing the Fifth Essence exists and remains
incorrupt, it will be the greatest thing for you if I teach you to extract it
from human blood, and from the flesh of all animals, and from eggs, and from
similar things.

Because since human blood is the perfect work of nature in us, as far as
restoring what is lost, it is certain that nature so perfected and perfects
that Fifth Essence, that without other preparation it transfers the blood
immediately from the veins into flesh.

And the method is this: Take blood and put it in a distillation vessel with
its alembic, and seal it well, and bury in horse dung until it is putrefied.
Then distill it and you will have the Fifth Essence of blood, which has
WONDROUS VIRTUE in restoring lost strength, in curing fevers, and in all
things which concern blood.

FOR FLESH: Take flesh of any animal and cut it into small pieces. Put in a
distillation vessel and let it putrefy in horse dung for forty days. Then
distill by degrees of fire, first light, then stronger. What comes out first
is the element of water, then the element of air (the oil), and what remains
is earth. These elements separated, the Fifth Essence is in the oil.

FOR EGGS: Take eggs and break them and put them whole in a glass vessel, and
seal well. Bury in horse dung for putrefaction. Then distill as above. The
Fifth Essence of eggs has marvelous virtue for RESTORING WHAT IS CONSUMED.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XI: EXTRACTING FROM FRUITS AND HERBS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In every fruit and in every herb in which there is heavenly influence and
virtue, there is Fifth Essence.

FOR FRUITS: Take ripe fruits and place in a glass vessel, let putrefy in
horse dung. Distill, and collect that which comes as oil -- this is the Fifth
Essence of fruits.

FOR HERBS: Take the herb you want and dry it in the shade (not sun). Grind to
powder and place in distillation vessel with aqua ardens. Seal well and
digest in horse dung. Then distill and the virtue of the herb will pass into
the aqua ardens with its Fifth Essence.

Note that THE FIFTH ESSENCE OF HERBS is wondrous for cures, because herbs
have influences from the stars under which they were generated. And the Fifth
Essence of each herb has the specific virtue of that herb MULTIPLIED A
HUNDREDFOLD.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XII: SEPARATING THE FOUR ELEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to extract separately the four elements from anything, this is
the mastery:

1. WATER: What first distills at low heat is the element of water.

2. AIR: What comes as oil after the water, this is the element of air. It
   floats on water.

3. FIRE: Increase the fire strongly, and a red substance will distill -- this
   is the element of fire.

4. EARTH: What remains in the bottom of the vessel, reduced to ash, is the
   element of earth.

The Fifth Essence is found principally in the element of fire (the red
substance), secondarily in the element of air (the oil). The earth and water
are the gross, corruptible parts.

TO GLORIFY THE FIFTH ESSENCE further: Take the element of fire and circulate
it in the circulation vessel for many days. It will become so glorified that
it will be as clear as crystal and fragrant beyond all worldly fragrance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XIII: FIXING THE SUN (GOLD) IN THE FIFTH ESSENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now I shall teach you how to ornament your heaven (the Fifth Essence) with
its sun, which is GOLD.

Know that common gold from mines or rivers, if you put it in aqua ardens or
Fifth Essence, confers nothing, because it is not converted into nutriment
but is excreted as taken.

But the GOLD OF THE PHILOSOPHERS, which is made through the magistery of the
Stone, this gold is wholly convertible into nutriment and into all virtue.

If you have the gold of the philosophers, file it into thin filings and put
it in the Fifth Essence. It will dissolve and give the Fifth Essence a golden
color and WONDROUS VIRTUE for:
  - Restoring youth
  - Comforting the heart
  - Making the old young
  - Curing all diseases of the heart

The Fifth Essence adorned with its sun is the SUPREME MEDICINE.

THE PLANETS AND THEIR METALS:
  - SUN = Gold (confers incorruptibility, comforts heart)
  - MOON = Silver (helps lunar conditions, menses)
  - MARS = Iron (strengthens, gives courage)
  - MERCURY = Quicksilver (mobility, mental acuity)
  - JUPITER = Tin (helps liver, digestion)
  - SATURN = Lead (helps spleen, melancholy)
  - VENUS = Copper (helps kidneys, generation)

Each metal, when its Fifth Essence is extracted, has the virtue of its
corresponding planet and can cure diseases under that planet's dominion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XIV: PRACTICAL METHOD FOR FIXING THE SUN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since few have the gold of the philosophers, I shall teach a method for
common men:

Take common gold and file it into the finest filings. Mix with sal ammoniac
and sublime. Repeat this sublimation seven times. The gold will become so
subtle that it will pass with the sal ammoniac.

Then take this sublimated gold and put in the strongest vinegar distilled,
and let it dissolve over many days. What dissolves, distill. The Fifth
Essence of gold will come over with the vinegar.

Or simpler: Take gold leaf and put in the circulation vessel with Fifth
Essence. Circulate for many days. The gold will slowly dissolve and color the
Fifth Essence golden. This is POTABLE GOLD.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XV: OBTAINING SOLAR INFLUENCE WITHOUT EXPENSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the poor Evangelical men who cannot afford gold, know that there are
certain herbs which carry the influence of the Sun and can ornament your
Fifth Essence almost as well:

SOLAR HERBS:
  - Chelidonia (celandine) -- golden flowers
  - Saffron (crocus) -- golden color
  - Marigold (calendula) -- follows the sun
  - Rosemary -- carries solar fire
  - Chamomile -- golden centers

Extract the Fifth Essence from these herbs and add to your aqua ardens. You
will have a medicine of SOLAR VIRTUE without expense of gold.

PEARLS also carry celestial virtue. Dissolve pearls in strong distilled
vinegar, and this solution added to Fifth Essence gives it stellar virtue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XVI: CONCEALING GOLD AND SILVER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a secret mastery for concealing gold and silver so they appear as
base metal, which some philosophers call "enchanting" them.

[Note: Rupescissa includes this for completeness but warns that such
knowledge is dangerous and can lead to counterfeiting -- a mortal sin. He
declines to teach the full method.]

The reverse operation -- making base metals appear as gold -- is the work of
SOPHISTICATORS AND DECEIVERS, who are damned. True philosophers seek not to
deceive but to heal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XVII: FIXING ALL TERRESTRIAL THINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The general mastery for fixing the Fifth Essence of any terrestrial thing is
this:

1. Take whatever you wish -- metal, mineral, plant, or animal matter
2. Reduce to powder or small pieces
3. Put in glass vessel with aqua ardens or Fifth Essence
4. Seal well with lute of wisdom
5. Digest in horse dung or other gentle heat
6. Allow putrefaction and then distillation to separate elements
7. The Fifth Essence will be in the oil or subtle distillate
8. Circulate this in circulation vessel to glorify further

By this method the Fifth Essence of ALL THINGS can be extracted and fixed,
carrying the specific virtue of each thing multiplied.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XVIII: THINGS HOT IN THE FIRST DEGREE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For compounding medicines, it is necessary to know which things are hot, cold,
wet, and dry, and in what degree.

THINGS HOT IN THE FIRST DEGREE (mild heating):
  - Chamomile (anthemis)
  - Anise
  - Sweet flag (calamus)
  - Rose
  - Violet
  - Borage
  - Bugloss
  - Endive (when not too mature)

These are useful for MILD CONDITIONS, for those of weak constitution, and for
beginning treatments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XIX: THINGS HOT IN THE SECOND DEGREE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THINGS HOT IN THE SECOND DEGREE (moderate heating):
  - Fennel
  - Parsley
  - Celery (apium)
  - Dill
  - Caraway
  - Cumin
  - Coriander
  - Hyssop
  - Mint
  - Oregano
  - Thyme
  - Sage
  - Rosemary
  - Lavender
  - Basil

These are useful for MODERATE CONDITIONS and for maintaining warmth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XX: THINGS HOT IN THE THIRD DEGREE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THINGS HOT IN THE THIRD DEGREE (strong heating):
  - Ginger
  - Galangal
  - Cinnamon
  - Cloves
  - Nutmeg
  - Mace
  - Pepper (black and white)
  - Cardamom
  - Mustard
  - Garlic
  - Onion
  - Leek
  - Radish
  - Rocket (eruca)

These are for STRONG CONDITIONS, cold diseases, and those of robust
constitution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XXI: THINGS HOT IN THE FOURTH DEGREE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THINGS HOT IN THE FOURTH DEGREE (burning):
  - Euphorbium
  - Pyrethrum (pellitory)
  - Long pepper
  - Spurge (euphorbia)
  - Hellebore
  - Scammony

USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION. These can burn the stomach and intestines. They are
only for desperate cases and must be tempered with cooling things or used in
very small quantities with the Fifth Essence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XXII: THINGS COLD IN THE FIRST DEGREE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THINGS COLD IN THE FIRST DEGREE (mild cooling):
  - Barley
  - Lettuce
  - Purslane
  - Cucumber
  - Melon
  - Violet leaves
  - Rose water
  - Endive
  - Chicory (when mature)

These gently cool without harming natural heat.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XXIII: THINGS COLD IN THE SECOND DEGREE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THINGS COLD IN THE SECOND DEGREE (moderate cooling):
  - Plantain
  - Nightshade (solanum)
  - Houseleek (sempervivum)
  - Portulaca
  - Coriander (seeds)
  - Vinegar
  - Sour fruits

These cool and restrain, useful for fevers and inflammations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XXIV: THINGS COLD IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH DEGREES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THINGS COLD IN THE THIRD DEGREE:
  - Poppy (papaver)
  - Henbane (hyoscyamus)
  - Mandrake (mandragora)
  - Water lily

THINGS COLD IN THE FOURTH DEGREE:
  - Opium
  - Hemlock (cicuta)

These are NARCOTIC AND DANGEROUS. They induce sleep, stupor, and in excess
cause death. Use only in extreme necessity and in the smallest quantities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTERS XXV-XXVIII: THINGS DRY IN DEGREES 1-4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DRY IN FIRST DEGREE: Barley, beans, lentils
DRY IN SECOND DEGREE: Most spices, dried herbs
DRY IN THIRD DEGREE: Alum, vitriol, iron rust
DRY IN FOURTH DEGREE: Quickite, calcined substances, caustics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XXIX: THINGS HUMID IN DEGREES 1-4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HUMID IN FIRST DEGREE: Most fresh fruits, fresh vegetables
HUMID IN SECOND DEGREE: Oils, fats, marrows
HUMID IN THIRD DEGREE: Honey, fresh blood
HUMID IN FOURTH DEGREE: Egg white, mucilages

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XXX: IDENTIFYING COMPOUND PROPERTIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most things have COMPOUND qualities. For example:
  - Pepper is hot in third degree and dry in second degree
  - Cucumber is cold in second degree and humid in second degree

The physician must know these to compound medicines correctly. The Fifth
Essence of each thing carries these properties multiplied.

RULE: When combining things in the Fifth Essence, contraries should be
balanced unless you intend a specific direction of treatment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XXXI: TEMPERATE THINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some things are TEMPERATE, balanced in all qualities:
  - Bread (well-made)
  - Young meat
  - Egg yolk
  - Good wine (not too strong)

These support nature without pushing it in any direction. The Fifth Essence
of temperate things is useful for maintenance and general strengthening.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XXXII: PURGATIVES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things that purge each humor:

FOR CHOLER (yellow bile):
  - Rhubarb (rheum)
  - Aloe
  - Cassia fistula
  - Manna
  - Tamarind

FOR PHLEGM:
  - Agaric
  - Turbith
  - Spurge
  - Colocynth
  - Elaterium

FOR MELANCHOLY (black bile):
  - Senna
  - Fumitory
  - Polypody
  - Black hellebore
  - Lapis lazuli

FOR BLOOD:
  - Bloodletting is the principal method
  - Red roses, violets, and prunes assist

The Fifth Essence of purgatives is FAR MORE POWERFUL than the crude herb --
use in much smaller quantities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XXXIII: RESTRICTIVES AND ASTRINGENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things that bind and restrain:
  - Oak bark and galls
  - Pomegranate rind
  - Sumac
  - Acacia
  - Plantain

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things that soften hardness:
  - Mallow
  - Marshmallow
  - Fenugreek
  - Linseed
  - Butter
  - Fresh animal fats
  - Oils

These dissolve hardened tumors and soften tissues for surgery.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XXXV: MATURATIVES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things that ripen and bring abscesses to a head:
  - Onion
  - Lily root
  - Fig
  - Leaven (yeast)
  - Wheat flour

These applied externally hasten the maturation of apostemes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XXXVI: MUNDIFICATIVES (CLEANSING)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things that clean wounds:
  - Honey
  - Turpentine
  - Myrrh
  - Aloe
  - Aristolochia
  - Iris

These clean ulcers and prepare them for healing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XXXVII-XXXIX: CORROSIVES, CAUSTICS, ATTENUANTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CORROSIVES remove proud flesh: Arsenic, vitriol, verdigris
CAUSTICS burn and destroy tissue: Quicklime, caustic potash
ATTENUANTS thin thick humors: Vinegar, oxymel, hyssop, horehound

USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION. These are for surgeons, not internal medicine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XL: EXTRACTION OF GOLD BY ANOTHER METHOD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you lack the philosophical gold, here is another way:

Take gold leaf and grind with mercury until amalgamated. Put in closed vessel
and heat gently. The mercury will sublime, carrying with it the subtle spirit
of gold. Collect this sublimate and dissolve in aqua ardens. You will have
the ESSENCE OF GOLD though not the true philosophical gold.

This is an oil of gold that has great sweetness and WONDROUS VIRTUE for
mitigating pain of wounds, healing wounds and ulcers, and many evils and
infirmities beyond what can be believed.

THIS YOU SHOULD REVEAL TO NO ONE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XLI: EXTRACTING QUINTESSENCE FROM SILVER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the Fifth Essence could be extracted from silver as from gold, I
shall teach you another method, AND IT IS A SUPREME MASTERY:

Take the vinegar of the philosophers [distilled vinegar] and into it put
noble calcined tartar and sal ammoniac in a glass amphora. Seal immediately
because the virtue would evaporate.

Put the calx of silver (which I taught you to make above, if you have
listened) into this, sealed with lute of wisdom, and hide in warm dung for
eight or ten days to putrefy.

Then put in distillation vessel, and first the vinegar will ascend. Then,
WHAT IS MARVELOUS, the Fifth Essence of silver will ascend in the manner of
quicksilver.

SUCH IS ITS VIRTUE in wondrous operations that it is permitted to reveal to
no one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XLII: EXTRACTING FROM MERCURY AND ROMAN VITRIOL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most glorious God so ordained that the Fifth Essence of quicksilver
together with the Fifth Essence of vitriol may be marvelously extracted:

When quicksilver is sublimated with them and with saltpeter (or common salt),
then the quicksilver ascends most white, and draws with it without doubt the
Fifth Essence of the vitriol.

And when you have quicksilver sublimated with these, you have invisibly the
Fifth Essence of them hidden within the whiteness of the quicksilver. AND
THAT INVISIBLE FIFTH ESSENCE IS CALLED THE SULPHUR OF THE PHILOSOPHERS, which
is invisible.

Therefore the philosophers say that their sulphur is not the vulgar or common
sulphur: and very few men have arrived at this knowledge.

And it immediately congeals mercury to a whiteness above that of snow: and
this because they are almost of the same nature, therefore it sublimates with
it.

Know that sublimated quicksilver has certain incombustible parts, and has a
Fifth Essence which cannot be corrupted by our art.

This Fifth Essence of mercury and vitriol together cures fistula, cancer, and
many other evils.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XLIII: THE ATHANOR (PHILOSOPHICAL FURNACE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To reduce sublimated quicksilver or its Fifth Essence into the water which
the philosophers call LAC VIRGINIS (Virgin's Milk):

The method is this: Take sublimated quicksilver or its Fifth Essence and put
in a glass or vitrified vessel, wide and shallow. Place it on a tripod in the
ATHANOR, that is, in the FURNACE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS.

THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ATHANOR:

Build the walls of the furnace round, one foot in height. Upon these elevated
walls adapt an iron plate with four feet, and make it so the sides of the
plate do not touch the walls of the furnace but are supported on those four
arms or feet.

So the heat which ascends from below can ascend as much through the sides in
a circuit around the plate as around the furnace. It is supposed that you
have made a small door near the ground through which coals are admitted.

Then above the walls from the plate upward, begin to build other walls in a
circle, for about half a palm or so. And you will place above a very round
dome made by the ingenuity of a potter, with which you will cover your
furnace.

And on the side above the plate make a hole, which you will close with a
fitted earthen door, so you can put in your hand to judge the degree of heat.

And thus you have your furnace. For it is certain to you, if you have
understanding, that this furnace will heat itself equally from every
circumference of it.

This furnace the philosophers call ATHANOR, and few men have arrived at the
knowledge of it. In this is done concoction and digestion equally from every
part.

The measure of fire in the digestion of all volatile things in our athanor is
that you should be able to put your hand through the door above the plate
into the furnace and hold it there without injury. And if the fire is too
great, diminish it.

THIS IS A THING GREAT BEYOND WHAT CAN BE BELIEVED.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XLIV: WHY HIGHER SECRETS ARE NOT REVEALED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because according to catholic philosophy, that is, according to sacred
Scripture, OBEDIENCE IS BETTER THAN SACRIFICE: on account of reverence for
the statutes of our Order, and obedience to the prelates of the holy Church
of God, those truly wondrous and supremely desired medicines of the world:

Which would not only cure our bodies as if miraculously from all diseases,
but would also TRANSMUTE THE IMPERFECT METALS INTO GOLD AND SILVER IN THE
TWINKLING OF AN EYE:

The truth of which mastery was intellectually revealed to me in the
tribulations of prisons, by God's will -- I SHALL BY NO MEANS REVEAL.

Because concerning alchemical operations it is not permitted for us to treat
in our religion. Therefore I make an end for you in the consideration of the
Fifth Essence, where operations and considerations of alchemy could or should
be mixed.

But I call to witness all Evangelical men, with God invoked as witness, that
IF BY THE DEVIL'S INSTIGATION THEY FALL INTO ALCHEMICAL OPERATIONS, THEY
SHALL BE GIVEN OVER TO A REPROBATE MIND.

And know that it is the way of perdition and evil, because NO PHILOSOPHER
WROTE THE TRUTH IN BOOKS except fictively and under parables, which cannot be
understood nor comprehended by human ingenuity.

And note also that NO ONE CAN ARRIVE AT THE SUBLIME HEIGHTS OF THIS ART
unless through the most high contemplation and most holy life his mind has
been first deified, so that he might not only know all the interior things of
nature, but also know how to transmute transmutable nature.

AND THIS HAS BEEN GRANTED TO VERY FEW.

And commonly the followers of fictions and sophistications become
COUNTERFEITERS OF MONEY, and of seals of prelates and Princes, vagabonds,
deceivers, and without religion, and of damnable life.

Of whom is truly verified the proverb of Paul in 2 Corinthians: "ALWAYS
LEARNING AND NEVER ARRIVING AT THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH."

Because when they cannot arrive at perfect knowledge, they turn to useless
sophistications, and commonly they end badly.

The remaining philosophical works supremely stupendous which I here pass over
in silence -- placed against God and justice, as on Judgment Day God will
show, by rivals in chains now seven entire years, among fetters and chains,
through sublime theories and celestial illuminations I have learned.

I shall insert in individual books (if God wills) and reveal most fully as I
can to you Evangelical men for whom I write.

IN THIS THEREFORE LET THE FIRST BOOK ON THE CONSIDERATION OF THE FIFTH
ESSENCE RECEIVE ITS END, to the glory and praise of omnipotent God and our
Lord Jesus Christ, for the consolation of good men and the honor of the
Church of God.

AMEN.

================================================================================
BOOK TWO: ON GENERAL REMEDIES
================================================================================

LIBER SECUNDUS QUI DE GENERALIBUS REMEDIIS APPELLATUR

THE SECOND BOOK WHICH IS CALLED "ON GENERAL REMEDIES"

Although the first book which is on the Consideration [of the Fifth Essence]
exists truly in virtue and truth, so that through it every curable disease
can be cured, if anyone wishes to ruminate deeply the principles of nature
and of art which I have disclosed:

Nevertheless, because not all, even those who seem to know something, know
how to correctly deduce a conclusion from principles against the misfortunes
of nature, I SHALL TEACH IN THIS SECOND BOOK how to procure REMEDIES FOR
HEALTH quickly, and as if miraculously for Evangelical men, so that from
these divine remedies they may be rendered able, courageous, and strong for
all labors of perfection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 1: AGAINST THE IMPEDIMENTS OF OLD AGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The mastery in the cure of the discomforts and reparation of former youth,
and restoration of lost nature and conservation of life in great and joyful
health up to the terminus of life appointed for us by God, is this:

Take the Fifth Essence of aqua ardens rectified in the circulation vessel up
to the highest fragrance, as the first book taught you. Into it infuse the
Fifth Essence of GOLD AND PEARLS.

With this divine potion let the old man use it morning and evening, each time
the quantity of a full nut. And within a few days he will arrive at such
soundness that he will manifestly feel himself to have RETURNED TO THE VIGOR
AND STATE OF 40 OR 50 YEARS, and will rejoice to have arrived at former
youth.

The mastery is in this: to use moderately and rarely the Fifth Essence
aforesaid, so that only the repaired youth, obtained health, restored nature,
is preserved in its being without notable augmentation or diminution.

And it is expedient in this mastery to learn that he should use good wine in
his meals, in which the Fifth Essence of gold and pearls is fixed, as the
first book taught.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 2: AGAINST DEATH AND REVIVING THE DEAD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this chapter we call "dead" not simply [the dead], but those of whom we
ultimately despair of life, who are indeed close to death, and abandoned by
physicians, and destitute of the acts of life, so that they do not even use
their senses, while they can nevertheless swallow a little.

To this dead person in respect we come to aid in this, that quickly enough he
may rise and speak and live, unless the final terminus of life given to him
by God has come upon him.

And the mastery of this visitation of the dead is that you administer the
Fifth Essence with which above you repair youth to the dead man: because
immediately when he has received a little bit in his stomach by swallowing or
in whatever manner, IT WILL INFLUENCE IN THE HEART AN INFLUX OF THE RAY OF
NATURAL HEAT AND LIFE.

And you will see him rise manifestly, and be strengthened, and be comforted
miraculously -- even nature already as if defunct and consumed.

And if you wish this to happen IN AN INSTANT AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE,
so that it may be believed an illusion from the sudden evident miracle, have
the herb CHELIDONIA [celandine], whose flower and fruit are golden-colored,
with the four elements extracted according to the method of the first book.
And from the element of fire put into the said water or Fifth Essence the
quantity of one grain of wheat.

And immediately when he has that in his stomach, HE WILL RISE AND SPEAK.

And then comfort him with administration of Fifth Essence, and he will be
cured, where God does not command him to die.

And I say to you that this is the highest mastery which is done in the whole
transmutation of nature: and to this NONE OF THE PHYSICIANS OF OUR TIME HAS
ATTAINED.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 3: AGAINST LEPROSY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because the just God inflicted upon us in punishment of sin the strokes of
great infirmities, and among other diseases the plague of leprosy is
detestable and ignominious to the human race, and its cure is more difficult
or impossible.

Because sometimes it is sent by God, as the leprosy of Constantine the Great
and of Gehazi, which can never be cured except by the virtue of God himself
inflicting it. But we here speak of the plague of leprosy which arises in men
from corruption of nature, not from the efficacious command of the Creator
but from the permission of the Creator.

And this disease can exist in two ways: in one way from a leprous father or
mother; in another way when one of the four principal humors (or rather the
mass of blood) putrefies and is corrupted in us.

The first way, when it is from a parent, is either difficult or entirely
impossible for us to cure. The second way is said to be difficult when it has
proceeded too far, but not impossible to cure.

And in this way we here intend [to treat] the cure of leprosy.

And because this chapter and its virtue is beyond what can be believed
wondrous, because the case of leprosy happens even to the greatest and most
powerful men, receive with thanksgiving to God this heavenly secret.

And know that THE SAME FIFTH ESSENCE already spoken of, with the addition of
the Fifth Essence of gold and pearls, PERFECTLY CURES, or if it has proceeded
too far, for the whole time of the man's life CONCEALS the plague of leprosy.

And the cause of this is that it corrodes and destroys corrupted humors of
whatever condition they exist, it equalizes unequal humors, and it comforts
healthy humors that have been weakened.

And in the case when the plague of leprosy should suddenly occur, let him use
aqua ardens until the Fifth Essence has been prepared: because I say to you
in Christ Jesus that not only the Fifth Essence aforesaid heals, but even
AQUA ARDENS either totally extinguishes leprosy or conceals it.

And I shall tell you a great and useful secret in the mastery of the cure of
leprosy: Take WATER MADE FROM STRAWBERRIES, for they are the fragrant fruit
of the month of May, and that water in the cure of leprosy has a beyond-
heavenly virtue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 4: AGAINST ALL KINDS OF SCABIES AND SKIN LESIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The water of divine action which I taught you to make diligently in the first
book (in the eighth science which begins "Blessed God the creator") heals
EVERY KIND OF SCABIES and skin eruptions, and crusts on the hands, arms,
neck, head, shoulders, hips, shins, feet, and all members -- it removes and
cures them.

Or when poor Evangelical men go preaching through the world and are injured
on their feet, with CALCINED TARTAR ALONE they will immediately be healed:
because it has the virtue of the Fifth Essence, since it is of the same
nature.

For the water of divine action heals all impetigo and serpigo. But it is
necessary that such persons use the Fifth Essence described above, or at
least aqua ardens, so that the interior humors may be purged and reduced to
harmony.

To purge the humors that offend as is fitting, it will be distinguished
below: which purgative things you should take from the chapters of the first
book.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 5: AGAINST PARALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All have agreed on this: that paralysis is caused by an abundance of viscous
humors closing the passages of the animal virtue, both motive and sensitive.

And all have said that those things which are too burning and desiccative and
hot HARM in its cure: but it is necessary that the curatives of this disease
be hot, humid (rather dry) and temperate, incisive of viscosity, and
gradually attractive, and comforting to the nerves.

And because no such thing in all nature could be found, FEW HAVE BEEN THOSE
who knew how to cure this infirmity, especially because it is universal.

For all incisive and evacuative things are mostly debilitating, and members
already too much weakened are destroyed with such things.

But our creator, the God of glory, created in aid of paralytic man THE FIFTH
ESSENCE AFORESAID, which above all things in this world created for bodily
use comforts, restores, and acts temperately.

Fix in it the Fifth Essence of some thing which purges phlegm and viscous
humors, such as a little euphorbium and turbith, or elder, or garden saffron
(i.e., safflower or saffron): and then without doubt, if the disease is
curable and there is no impediment from God's command, THE PARALYTIC WILL BE
HEALED (which is wondrous to say) with comforting and reparation of nature.

Make for him a warm and humid bath with the herbs ivy and sage, which have
a divine and superheavenly virtue for comforting the joints, nerves, muscles,
and motive virtue.

And if you do not have the Fifth Essence prepared at hand, use aqua ardens
until you have prepared it: because without doubt aqua ardens is the
INFALLIBLE ROOT of the cure of the body and animal health against every
disease, especially if (as I said) the Fifth Essence is joined to it.

Continue the remedy, because a serious disease needs no brief time: but he
who perseveres long in the labor of the cure will be healed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 6: AGAINST THOSE CONSUMED IN THE WHOLE BODY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And the cure of all these is INFALLIBLE with the Fifth Essence: for I have
already said that it comforts weak nature, restores what is lost, and
preserves what is restored.

And if you notably desire to restore flesh in a too emaciated and consumed
body, extract the four elements from the herb CHELIDONIA (celandine)
according to the mastery of the first book (for chelidonia is perfect for
making one fat), and mix the element of air (which is the good oil) in the
Fifth Essence or in aqua ardens.

And within a few days the user will be MIRACULOUSLY RESTORED, and fat beyond
what can be believed.

There is no thing which in this cure can be compared to these remedies.

Below I shall teach you in the cure of acute fever a comforting food, which
the hectic, phthisic, and emaciated should use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 7: AGAINST PHANTASTICAL PASSIONS, IMAGINATIONS, AND DEMONIC
         TEMPTATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain experience teaches that choleric men are given to certain
imaginations, phlegmatic to certain others, and sanguine men are occupied by
others.

But THOSE WHO ABOUND IN BLACK BILE -- these are those who are involved in the
most horrible cogitations. For that humor ascends so fully to the brain, and
disturbs all the powers of the brain, generates harmful images, and induces a
crowd of horrible cogitations both waking and sleeping.

And of this kind are those in whose generation or disposition of body the
misfortune of Saturn has flowed, and especially if it was of evil being: for
to such men demons willingly assist, and minister their hidden temptations
within the concourse of cogitations.

And these thus afflicted are compelled to contend with their passions, to
speak with themselves, to dispute with themselves, even so as to be heard by
bystanders.

And these are those who, vexed both by melancholic passions and by demons,
sometimes despair and KILL THEMSELVES.

The cure of all these is without doubt (unless perhaps the disease is
ministered by God's efficacious command), until they feel themselves fully
cured, to use the Fifth Essence aforesaid, or the best aqua ardens until the
Fifth Essence is had.

And in the aqua ardens put a little senna or fumitory or pith of elder or
lapis lazuli: and use discreetly, because without doubt you will be perfectly
healed.

Because not only does the Fifth Essence perfectly heal, but even aqua ardens
with a little of those things which expel black bile: and it purges
superfluous black bile, heals the spleen, removes the disturbance of
thoughts, makes the sad joyful, purifies the brain and all its powers,
induces happy thoughts, removes the artifice of demonic temptation, annuls
imaginings of despair, and makes one forget all evils, and men return to
their natural senses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 8: AGAINST FEAR AND INCONSTANCY AND DESTRUCTION OF THE HEART
         AND LOSS OF FORTITUDE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I did not say to you in vain that neither the intellect can grasp nor our
tongue narrate the miraculous virtues which God created in the Fifth Essence:
and not only in it, but also in its mother, namely aqua ardens.

Take therefore PEONY and the herb (or root) ANGELICA, and saffron and the
Fifth Essence of gold and pearls, and mix with the Fifth Essence: for
suddenly, as if miraculously, if a man who has been seized with excessive
terror takes these, HE WILL LOSE HIS FEAR, will recover fortitude lost from
terror, will assume courage, will DESPISE DEATH, will not panic in dangers,
will become bold beyond measure, so that it will appear to men that he is
prepared to penetrate walls of iron.

Believe the experienced one, because I certainly say the truth and certain
things, a proven experiment.

Therefore it is a precaution that the Christian prince in the order of wars
should have AQUA ARDENS thus prepared in barrels, so that he may give to each
fighter half a cup or so at the beginning of the warlike engagement.

And this secret ought to be hidden from all enemies of the Church. Neither
the prince nor any ministers ought to reveal this to anyone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 9: FOR PUTTING DEMONS AND BEWITCHMENTS TO FLIGHT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sacred Scripture in the book of Tobit chapter six manifestly teaches us
that by virtue created by God in animals, demons CAN be put to flight and
expelled from the habitation of houses: as by precept of the angel Raphael in
chapter eight he placed a part of the liver on coals and PUT THE DEMON TO
FLIGHT.

And the angel Raphael in chapter six says: "If you place a little piece of
the heart of a fish on coals, its smoke EXTRICATES EVERY KIND OF DEMON,
whether from a man or from a woman, so that they no longer come near them."

It is therefore a great question which the Doctors of Theology raise: WHETHER
BY SUCH VIRTUE CREATED BY GOD IN CORPOREAL THINGS DEMONS CAN IN TRUTH BE PUT
TO FLIGHT?

And there is no one whom I have seen thinking anything except that, however
much by such virtue our body is disposed so that demons do not find
melancholic humor or otherwise apt for operating in us, through such virtue
demons are not otherwise put to flight from us.

But whatever men may opine, THIS MUST BE FAITHFULLY CONFESSED BY US AS
CATHOLIC DOGMA: that if we place a little piece of the heart of that fish
upon coals, the smoke extricates every kind of demon whether from a man or
from a woman, so that it does not come near them further.

Now see this: since our Fifth Essence is made heavenly and brought to such
great fragrance beyond what can be believed, so that it almost seems to
participate in the glory of paradise, and to make man joyful, and to be able
to put to flight phantastical sadness which demons love, it is manifest that
it contradicts the conditions of demons, and extricates and expels them from
man and woman.

But especially this happens more efficaciously with the Fifth Essence of gold
and pearls, and with the seed of the herb which is called HYPERICON or
PERFORATA [St. John's Wort].

For that seed is called by the most approved philosophers FUGA DAEMONUM
(Flight of Demons): and it has been experienced many times that that seed
alone expels pestiferous demons from the habitations of houses. And in our
time it PUT TO FLIGHT AN INCUBUS DEMON from a certain girl.

And JUNIPER has the greatest and very marvelous virtue: so that if you make a
fire from juniper wood and from the ashes hide one live coal from juniper
wood with a little wood, it is reported that after a year you will find fire.

And the bile of a BLACK MALE DOG so stinks and displeases demons that if it
is sprinkled in a house, immediately bewitchments cease, demons flee, nor can
enchantments be done in it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 10: AGAINST LICE AND ITCHING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fomentation of the generation of lice and itchings and calefactions in
the body is PUTREFACTION OF HUMORS. For nature emits putrefied humors through
the pores of the skin, and in the opening of the pores from corrupted humors
are generated worms, itchings, and calefactions.

And because these arise from corruption, there is nothing medicinal in the
world which better cures than THAT WHICH PRESERVES FROM PUTREFACTION, and
consumes corrupted humors, as our Fifth Essence: which if you do not have at
hand, use in its place the best aqua ardens, because in it is God's virtue.

Therefore it is concluded that if you can preserve dead things in it so that
they are without putrefaction or corruption, much more strongly the living
flesh will be preserved from corruption.

And when I was unjustly held in a dark prison by my enemies, because my body
was corrupted by the malice of chains and prison, I devised, by the kindness
of a servant, to have aqua ardens from a certain man of God and friend of
mine: and by anointing alone with it done around the place, I was cured.

But I shall teach you to multiply its power A HUNDREDFOLD: because if within
aqua ardens you mix quicksilver and staphisagria, its virtue will be
augmented for killing lice, to such an extent that BY THE ODOR ALONE they
flee and also perish.

For the odor alone of quicksilver is their mortal poison: so that there the
miraculous virtue of God appears manifestly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 11: FOR EXPELLING POISON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The plague of poison is cured in this, that one most potently opposes it:
what, I ask, opposes death except life?

Therefore nothing created in the world more strongly opposes poison than AQUA
VITAE, and most especially the Fifth Essence which I described.

Work diligently, because there is nothing stronger in this world which
opposes mortal and lethal poisons than aqua vitae, which is aqua ardens, and
especially its Fifth Essence.

Because it conserves and augments life, guards the heart. Because immediately
when it is in the stomach it runs to the heart, and repels injury. And
because it is of the strongest action, having joined battle with poison, it
expels it from the body, or at least puts it to flight from the heart.

Infuse therefore in the Fifth Essence qualities opposing poison and which
comfort the heart, such as the Fifth Essence of gold, pearls, saffron, peony,
angelica, nuts, garlic, the best theriac, fennel, radish, rue.

And the virtues of it will be augmented. And also all stones which are useful
for expelling poison, put within the Fifth Essence or aqua ardens, and it
will obtain the power and property of them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 12: AGAINST QUARTAN FEVER AND ALL CONDITIONS OF MELANCHOLY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the whole world that physician is held greatest among others who within a
few days could put quartan fever to flight from a man: because that infirmity
from excessive duration kills slowly, damages the poor, impedes servants, and
frequently induces death.

And all agree on this, that quartan is generated from abundant melancholy
which is corrupted within the body: and it is a terrestrial humor, and by
nature slow, and lasts in many beyond a year.

If therefore you wish to cure it in a short time, THE FIFTH ESSENCE ALONE
cures this. I have already said that it expels corrupted humors, and reduces
nature to equality, and puts sadness to flight, and induces joy.

For if you do not have the Fifth Essence, take the best aqua ardens (one
pound), into which water put pith of elder and black hellebore, and give to
the patient morning and evening two full nuts or less, and certainly he will
be cured if it is continued until he is cured.

The philosophers have said that a tooth extracted from a living animal
liberates from quartan if carried. They have also said that if the juice of
the herb which is called red pimpernel is placed in the nostrils of a patient
with quartan, when he begins to suffer, he is cured.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 13: AGAINST THE IMPEDIMENTS AND DANGERS OF MEDICINE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the origin of the world the entire multitude of natural philosophers has
not ceased with the heaviest labor to investigate around laxative medicines
THREE THINGS:

First, that they not cause a fall of virtue.
Second, that they not kill.
Third, that when necessary they may act efficaciously and without danger in
      remote parts, and powerfully draw corrupted humors from them.

And these three things COULD NEVER BE PERFECTLY FOUND.

For every evacuation has an eye toward fall of virtue, weakness of body,
injury of vision, and connected things. And never could so certain a measure
be found which could with equal weight be ministered to all.

Because bodies do not receive equally the action of a dose in rare, dense,
and solid [tissues].

And therefore it frequently happens that what is ministered healthfully to
some is administered to others lethally unto death. And it sometimes happens
that because many laxative medicines are also poisonous, they harm from one
side and heal from another.

And among physicians some have highly praised aloes, because it seems less to
cause fall of virtue, and is proven to comfort the members.

But Almighty God created the Fifth Essence of aqua ardens highly rectified
through the circulation vessel, as is taught in the first book: which
together with the Fifth Essence of gold and pearls, equalizes all humors, and
kills all fevers.

WITH THIS MASTERY, ALL THE AFORESAID INCONVENIENCES ARE AVOIDED: because the
Fifth Essence and even aqua ardens (if the Fifth Essence cannot be had)
conserves nature and augments it, and does not permit a fall of virtue to
occur.

Also because it itself infuses life, it also counteracts the killing of
medicines, provided that laxatives are ministered moderately with it.

And also because it is more noble and penetrating than all, it efficaciously
leads all laxative medicines with it to distant members and to deep places,
and miraculously draws harmful humors from those places.

THIS IS THE KEY OF THE ART: without whose clear understanding you should
never presume to minister laxative medicines through this book.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 14: AGAINST CONTINUOUS FEVER AND ITS CURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All philosophical men have decreed that continuous fever is generated from
putrefaction of blood and corruption of humors: in it therefore the cure is
to purge the blood, to remove all its corruption, to equalize disordered and
unequal humors, to repair fallen nature, and to preserve what is repaired.

But ALL THESE the Fifth Essence PERFECTLY OPERATES and completes.

For experience teaches to the eye that aqua ardens emits from blood watery
and corrupted humors, and preserves dead flesh from putrefaction: therefore
much more it will preserve the blood of the living and animated body from
putrefaction.

And if aqua ardens has not been fully purified from the ardor of the four
elements, its use is not advised in the cure of continuous fever: but the
Fifth Essence of it rectified, since it is not hot or humid, cold or dry like
the four elements, it fully and safely heals continuous fevers, especially
with the Fifth Essence of gold and pearls.

And if you wish to cure it perfectly, have the Fifth Essence of human blood
highly rectified as the first book teaches. For it is that which perfectly
cures fever, not only drunk, but also if with it the temples and everywhere
in the body the pulsating veins are anointed.

If therefore you join these said Fifth Essences, you will have true medicine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 15: AGAINST TERTIAN FEVER AND ITS CURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tertian fever from excessive abundance of red choler and putrefaction is
proven by the wise to be caused.

And if you wish to cure it quickly, take the Fifth Essence, or if you do not
have it, take aqua ardens, and in it put a little rhubarb, or Cretan aloe, or
another thing from the tables of the first book that purges red bile, and a
good quantity of endive and the herb called monk's head [dandelion], and use
this water morning and evening, and without doubt it will be cured quickly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 16: AGAINST QUOTIDIAN FEVER AND ITS CURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All masters agree that quotidian fever is generated from putrefaction of
phlegm and its abundance.

And since phlegm is cold and humid, but our Fifth Essence, and in its absence
aqua ardens, has the power to eradicate and cure disordered and too cold and
watery humid putrefaction:

Put therefore in it a little euphorbium according to the rules of the wise,
or elder or other things which purge phlegm from the table of the first book,
and use morning and evening, and with God's grace you will arrive at health.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 17: AGAINST ACUTE FEVER AND ITS CURE, AND ON THE CURE OF
          FRENETICS AND MADMEN AND FOOLS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And because in the mastery of all medicine it is expedient to weigh prudently
all words and works: because aqua ardens ascends to the head and willingly
intoxicates, since acute fever especially rages in the region of the head (on
account of ascending vapors), it is excluded from the mastery of the cure of
acute fever.

It is therefore necessary for you to take our Fifth Essence rectified with
the Fifth Essence of gold and pearls: and on the other hand to have the Fifth
Essence of human blood well rectified: and use this in the name of Jesus
Christ, putting a sixth part upon ten of our aforesaid Fifth Essence with the
Fifth Essence of rose water, and also violet water, and of borage and
lettuces.

And you will have indeed a heavenly medicine in the true cure of it.

And since acute fever is commonly generated from violent yellow bile most
burnt, and burnt blood, and burnt black bile, and sometimes from one of
these, and sometimes together from two, sometimes together from three:

And according to this, acute fever in the positive, comparative, and
superlative degree has been found by the wisest: with all things weighed, you
will give the Fifth Essence of blood (because it opposes burning from the
whole species) with a sixth part of our aforesaid Fifth Essence to the
patient, and he will be quickly cured, by God's work.

And when you see the patient convalescing a little, put in the Fifth Essence
of blood a fifth part of our Fifth Essence: and afterward in greater
convalescence a fourth part, then a third, and afterward half, then less of
the Fifth Essence of blood.

And because acute fever commonly has annexed to it alienation of sense and
appearance of phantastical things: for burned humors cause the fever.

For if the patient says he sees black things, black bile is burnt: if golden
things, red bile is burnt: if red things and effusion of blood, then without
doubt the blood is burnt.

And to cure frenzy and its stupidity and to mitigate fury, take a good
quantity of POPULEON UNGUENT, and of the best vinegar that can be had, and of
domestic rue in good quantity, grind and confect with the aforesaid, and mix
the Fifth Essence of blood with them if you can have it.

And with this superheavenly confection wrap the head of the patient, and put
some to the nostrils: and this divine confection immediately puts frenzy to
flight, cures phantastical appearances, restores sense and discretion, and
makes him rest. Keep this and persevere in the work, and God will help you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 18: ON THE CURE OF HEMITERTIAN FEVERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Those who have perfectly known in the mastery of medicine assert that three
hemitertians are sometimes generated perilously in our body: the lesser,
middle, and greater.

For hemitertian is a fever generated from corrupted and contrary humors: such
as if a fever is compounded in a man from putrefied phlegm, so it will be a
cold and humid fever, and if from putrefied red bile, so it will be a hot and
dry fever.

And together in one body will be two fevers and contrary by nature: the
imprudent physician will judge their cures impossible.

Because if he ministers to this patient against hot and dry fever something
cold and humid, he will greatly augment the cold and humid one, and
conversely.

And if he ministers hot and dry together with cold and humid in equal parts,
one impedes the other in acting, and cure will not follow.

IT IS THEREFORE THE TRUEST CURE to minister the Fifth Essence aforesaid mixed
with the Fifth Essence of blood, and with the Fifth Essence of gold and
pearls, and with the Fifth Essence of things purging the offending humors.
And with this dose quickly and miraculously all hemitertians without doubt
will vanish.

And note that hemitertians are generated in our body in as many ways as you
can combine the four principal corrupted humors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 19: AGAINST PESTILENTIAL FEVERS AND THEIR CURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It would be phantastical and foolish to seek a remedy when the disease is
incurable and sent to destroy the people by the efficacious command of God,
against which there is no remedy except from God's benignity: because it is
hard for us to kick against the goad.

But that God sends pestilence upon the people by efficacious command is clear
in Deuteronomy chapter 28, where it says: "If you will not hear the voice of
the Lord your God, to keep and do all his commandments... all these curses
shall come upon you... You shall be cursed in the city and in the field...
The Lord will attach pestilence to you until he consumes you from the
earth..."

To the point: what phantastical are your plagues of pestilential scourges
sent incurably by God, as the sacred text says, so that they cannot be cured?
If you presumed to cure them, it would be phantastical and insane to attempt.

It is to be known however that men can die in THREE WAYS:

1. In one way at the terminus appointed for us by God by natural death, which
   we cannot pass by any natural ingenuity.

2. In another way by violent death: and in those two ways medicine is in vain.

3. In another way casually or occasionally, short of the terminus appointed
   for us by God: as those who by excessive repletion or dissolution, or
   severe abstinence, or desperation, or negligence of avoiding the danger of
   death, kill themselves.

And in that way, when God sends plagues and pestilences to certain persons of
the people through the world, those whom God does not efficaciously command
to perish through the plague CAN either willingly or negligently incur
dangers of death if they wish.

So therefore let us deal with the cure of pestilences:

I say therefore as a general rule that God, whether he sends pestilence from
the influence of Saturn (as is the plague of leprosy, rheum, phthisis,
consumption, and all things which happen in man from the malice of
pestilential cold), or from the influence of Mars (as is pestilential fever
with spitting of blood, aposteme under the diaphragm suffocating the heart,
very large pustules under the armpits or in the groin, or anthrax,
carbuncles, or sacred fire, and similar things), or from the influence of
maleficiated Mercury (as are buboes on the eyebrows, in the beard, on the
chest), or from maleficiated Moon (as are epilepsy, horrible dreams which
make men mad):

WHETHER WHATEVER OTHER PESTILENCES SENT BY GOD THROUGH OTHER INFLUENCES --
all such are perfectly cured and avoided with our Fifth Essence.

In pestilential fever however and all ardors of sicknesses and burnings, add
to the Fifth Essence half of the Fifth Essence of human blood, and root of
bugloss, or its whole herb, also sorrel, and a little hepatic aloe,
euphorbium, hierapicra, and the Fifth Essence of the root of lily, of gold
and pearls, of maidenhair and hyssop.

All these efficaciously oppose such fevers and apostemes.

It is expedient that with the aforesaid there be a laxative Fifth Essence,
and let so much be taken each day that once in a natural day, three times in
a week, it leads the man in liquid material.

And every day in the morning let him take a little good aqua ardens, namely
an eggshell, and four or six times in the day if it is expedient, a full
Gallic nut or hazelnut shell.

And the corrupted air without doubt will not harm, and let him use all those
things which the philosophers have proven in their books to oppose
pestilence.

And accommodate pills from their books in the Fifth Essence or aqua ardens:
but let them be put in moderately.

And let lodgings be fumigated three times a day and strongly, with
frankincense, myrrh, resin, terebinthine or larch resin, rue, and such
things.

AND THIS IS THE PERFECT CURE of the pestilences already spoken of.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMEDY 20 (FINAL): HOW FEVER MAY BE GENERATED IN SPASM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The wisest philosophers have affirmed it to be healthy for fever to be born
in spasm.

And they have said from experience that if you rub all the arteries with the
juice of buttercup, the patients will continuously become feverish: and thus
the malice of spasm is tempered.

And because spasm according to the wise arises from injury and weakness of
the nerves, as is sometimes evident in medicines taken from hellebore,
nothing more efficaciously sedates spasm than the most noble Fifth Essence,
or in its absence aqua ardens.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXPLICIT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HERE ENDS THE BOOK ON THE CONSIDERATION OF THE FIFTH ESSENCE OF ALL THINGS,
handed down to the poor and Evangelical men: and also on the servitude of
Philosophy to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

To Almighty God, Father and Son and Holy Spirit, be praise through infinite
ages of ages.

AMEN.

================================================================================
KEY CONCEPTS SUMMARY
================================================================================

THE QUINTA ESSENTIA (FIFTH ESSENCE):
- The incorruptible celestial element made accessible on earth
- Extracted from wine through repeated distillation (up to 1000 times)
- Neither hot/cold/wet/dry like the four corruptible elements
- Preserves from corruption what is immersed in it
- Balances all qualities -- restores what is lacking, removes excess

THREE NAMES FOR THE SAME SUBSTANCE:
1. Aqua ardens -- "burning water" (it combusts, unlike elemental water)
2. Anima vini / Spiritus -- "soul/spirit of wine"
3. Aqua vitae -- "water of life"
4. [Secret name] Quinta Essentia -- used to conceal from the unworthy

THE SUN AND STARS:
- The Sun = GOLD (specifically the "gold of the philosophers")
- The Stars = Medicinal herbs with astrological correspondences
- These "ornament" the quintessence for specific therapeutic effects

HEAT WITHOUT FIRE (for poor Evangelical men):
1. Horse dung (gentle heat from decomposition)
2. Fermenting grape must
3. Solar radiation

THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENT:
- The four elements are corruptible; nothing made of them can preserve
- The heavens (quinta essentia) are incorruptible
- Therefore we must find an earthly substance with heavenly properties
- Distilled alcohol has these properties and can be further "glorified"

THEOLOGICAL CAVEATS:
- Cannot extend life beyond God's appointed terminus
- But CAN preserve health and cure disease up to that limit
- This knowledge is for the worthy alone -- the greedy must not know
- This is lawful and not "phantastical"

THE CONCEALMENT DOCTRINE:
- "When you wish to conceal it, call it quinta essentia"
- The philosophers "wished to reveal to no one" and "let the truth be
  buried with them"
- The book is for "the poor and Evangelical men" only
- God should "impede those wishing to do the contrary"

            from wine, blood, flesh, eggs, herbs, metals, and minerals,
            including detailed pharmacological catalogs (things hot, cold,
            wet, dry in four degrees).

  BOOK TWO: 20 remedies applying quintessence to diseases including old age,
            leprosy, paralysis, fevers, melancholy, demonic afflictions,
            poisons, and pestilence.
