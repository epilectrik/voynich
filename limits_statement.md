# Limits Statement

*Status: MANDATORY EPISTEMOLOGICAL BOUNDARY*

## Purpose

This document explicitly states what the external comparative research (Tracks A-E) **cannot** explain, justify, or prove. It defines the hard boundary between contextualization and interpretation.

---

## What This Research CANNOT Do

### 1. Identify the Manuscript's Purpose

The comparative research shows that the Voynich's design patterns are **historically attested** for a class of technical manuals. It does NOT prove:

- ❌ The manuscript is a distillation manual
- ❌ The manuscript is an apparatus operation guide
- ❌ The manuscript has any specific historical function

**The internal frozen model identifies structural features. The external research shows those features are not arbitrary. Neither identifies purpose.**

---

### 2. Assign Meanings to Tokens

The 49 instruction classes remain operationally defined:

- ❌ "k means fire"
- ❌ "h means condensation"
- ❌ "e means equilibrium"

The kernel semantics (Phase 17) are **inferential overlays** derived from process alignment, not proven identities. The external research does not change this.

---

### 3. Identify Materials, Products, or Substances

The manuscript encodes 0 material/product information (Phase 19: PURE_OPERATIONAL). External research cannot recover:

- ❌ What was distilled
- ❌ What plants the illustrations depict
- ❌ What substances the recipes produce

**If the original operator knew what was being processed, that knowledge is external to the manuscript.**

---

### 4. Prove Historical Identity

Pattern alignment is NOT identification:

- ❌ "The Voynich is by Brunschwig"
- ❌ "The Voynich comes from Strasbourg"
- ❌ "The Voynich dates to 1500"

The research shows structural homology (8/8 Brunschwig match, Phase HCG). This means the Voynich is **compatible with** 15th-century distillation practice—not that it **is** a 15th-century distillation manual.

---

### 5. Explain the Illustrations

The illustrations are EPIPHENOMENAL (Phase ILL):

- ❌ External research cannot assign meanings to plant drawings
- ❌ External research cannot link illustrations to text
- ❌ External research cannot recover what the illustrator intended

The internal model proves illustrations do not constrain execution. External research cannot explain what they do mean.

---

### 6. Recover the Language (If Any)

The DSL hypothesis was REJECTED (Phase X.5):

- ❌ External research cannot identify a natural language encoding
- ❌ External research cannot provide translation
- ❌ External research cannot identify phonetic values

The manuscript is non-linguistic. External research on linguistic manuals does not apply.

---

### 7. Identify the Author or Community

Human factors patterns are **generic to expert communities**:

- ❌ "The author was an apothecary"
- ❌ "The community was a monastic order"
- ❌ "The tradition was Paracelsian"

The T3 PRIVATE SCHOOL classification (Phase 12) identifies structural characteristics, not historical actors.

---

### 8. Explain Why 8 Recipe Families

The 8 recipe families are **observer-imposed regularities** (Phase FSS: EMERGENT):

- ❌ External research cannot explain why exactly 8
- ❌ External research cannot identify what the 8 families "really are"
- ❌ External research cannot prove families correspond to historical categories

The internal model proves families are grammatically compatible. External research shows enumeration is rational. Neither explains the specific count.

---

### 9. Validate the Apparatus Identification

The circulatory reflux match (Phase ARE: 100% CLASS_D) is:

- ✅ Structural homology
- ❌ NOT proof of apparatus identity
- ❌ NOT recoverable without external evidence

The apparatus layer is explicitly marked "External, Non-Binding" in the frozen model.

---

### 10. Modify the Internal Grammar

The internal grammar is FROZEN (Phase X.2):

- ❌ External research cannot add constraints
- ❌ External research cannot remove constraints
- ❌ External research cannot reinterpret internal findings

**External research is comparative and explanatory. It operates at a different epistemic level from internal structural analysis.**

---

## What This Research CAN Do

| Permitted | Basis |
|-----------|-------|
| Contextualize design choices | Historical precedent exists |
| Explain why patterns are rational | Human factors research |
| Identify structural homology | Non-causal pattern matching |
| Suggest lines of external inquiry | Comparative pointers |
| Demonstrate non-arbitrariness | Multiple independent sources agree |

---

## Hard Boundaries (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Internal model is frozen.** External research does not modify it.
2. **No semantic decoding.** Tokens remain operationally defined.
3. **No translation.** The manuscript is non-linguistic.
4. **No historical identification.** Homology ≠ identity.
5. **No illustration interpretation.** Illustrations are epiphenomenal.

---

## Why These Limits Matter

The Voynich Manuscript has attracted centuries of speculation. Most "decipherments" fail because they confuse:

- **Pattern alignment** with **identification**
- **Structural homology** with **historical proof**
- **Rational design** with **known intent**

This research carefully avoids those errors by maintaining explicit epistemic boundaries.

---

## Summary

The external comparative research shows:
- ✅ The Voynich's design is rational
- ✅ Historical precedent exists for similar documents
- ✅ Human factors principles explain several structural features

It does NOT show:
- ❌ What the manuscript means
- ❌ Who wrote it
- ❌ What it was used for
- ❌ What substances are involved

**The gap between "rational design" and "known purpose" remains unbridged.**
