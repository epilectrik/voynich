  "FINAL_INTERPRETATION": "FINAL PROCESS CLASS IDENTIFICATION\n\nThe Voynich manuscript's control grammar most closely matches:\n**Reflux Distillation / Azeotropic Systems**\n\nSTRUCTURAL ALIGNMENTS:\n\n1. 4-CYCLE = Physical process stages\n   HEAT -> VAPORIZE -> CONDENSE -> RETURN -> (repeat)\n\n2. SINGLE ATTRACTOR = Steady-state operating regime\n   The system seeks and maintains optimal purification conditions.\n\n3. FORBIDDEN TRANSITIONS = Empirical failure modes\n   The 17 forbidden micro-transitions represent process failures that were\n   discovered through practice and encoded to prevent repetition.\n\n4. BIMODAL REPETITION = REFLUX_RATIO\n   Hub nodes (22.95x) = primary operations requiring many iterations\n   Spoke nodes (8.69x) = auxiliary operations requiring fewer iterations\n\n5. 94.6% REVERSIBILITY = Thermodynamic reversibility\n   Most operations can be undone, consistent with equilibrium-based purification.\n\n6. 97.7% LADDER-TO-CYCLE = Process completion rate\n   Almost all sequences return to start - purification loops complete.\n\n7. EXTERNAL TERMINATION = Operator determines completion\n   The process continues until purity is verified externally.\n\nPHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:\n\nThe manuscript encodes practical know-how for Reflux Distillation / Azeotropic Systems:\n- A-text entries = Material specifications and setup parameters\n- B-text entries = Active purification procedures\n- Hub categories = Core substances/operations that everything touches\n- 4-cycles = Maintenance loops keeping process in viable regime\n- 3-cycles (tria prima) = Secondary regulatory loops\n\nThe system is designed for REPEATABLE, ROBUST, ERROR-TOLERANT operation:\n- 100% convergence even from wrong starting point\n- 68% convergence even skipping steps\n- 1-step recovery from most errors\n- Self-correcting tendency toward stable operation\n\nIMPLICATIONS:\n\n1. The author had PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE with this process\n2. The failures encoded came from REAL experiments\n3. The system was designed for TEACHING/TRANSMISSION\n4. The quantitative structure (repetition counts) may encode RECIPES\n5. The visual material likely depicts APPARATUS/MATERIALS\n\nCONFIDENCE: HIGH (6.0/7 alignment score)",
