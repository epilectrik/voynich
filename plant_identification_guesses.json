      "confidence": "LOW",
      "reasoning": "Single large lobed leaf with white stem is unusual. The white comma-shaped markings could represent spots or stylized venation. Arum species have single large leaves and were common in medieval herbals. The white/pale stem and prominent root also fit Arum.",
      "medieval_use": "Arum was used medicinally (though toxic). Comfrey for wound healing.",
      "notes": "The white markings are very distinctive - may be artistic convention rather than botanical accuracy"

      "alternative_guesses": ["Privet (Ligustrum)", "Box (Buxus)", "Periwinkle (Vinca)"],
      "confidence": "MEDIUM",
      "reasoning": "Opposite oval leaves, branching woody stem, small flowers at leaf axils. Myrtle was extremely common in medieval Mediterranean gardens and herbals. The leaf shape and arrangement are consistent.",
